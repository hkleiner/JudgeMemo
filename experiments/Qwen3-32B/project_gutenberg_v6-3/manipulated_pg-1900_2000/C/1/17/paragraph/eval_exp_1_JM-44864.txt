Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "unforseen" should be "unforeseen"  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or inconsistent punctuation in some complex sentences (e.g., "whether he were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short or not")  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in long, complex sentences that disrupts natural flow  
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or unclear word usage (e.g., "rascal will always be asleep," "shrewd apprentice") may be stylistic but affects clarity for modern readers  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in run-on sentences (e.g., "He was generally a man of large frame, made larger by indulgence, and of great bodily power--which was useful to him.")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between unrelated topics (e.g., from coaching to religious experience of Bahá’u’lláh)  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in tone and subject from historical accounts of coaching to philosophical musings on morality and biography  
- [TRANSITION] Poor transitions between paragraphs, making it difficult to follow the narrative flow  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references in some sentences (e.g., "The experience of Divine Revelation, touched on only at secondhand...") without clear connection to the rest of the text  
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent focus on main theme (coaching) with frequent digressions  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
