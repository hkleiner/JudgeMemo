Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect use of "There it was stated" without clear antecedent.  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "We might say, 'Hath not a woman eyes?...'" which disrupts natural flow.  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of archaic or formal language ("prick us," "tickle us") inconsistent with modern style.  
- [SPELLING] "waggon-loads" is non-standard spelling (should be "wagons").  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences (e.g., "In 1795 there was actual famine, which was met by the famous system of doles out of the rates, in augmentation of wages").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between topics (e.g., from woman suffrage to 18th-century French art).  
- [LOGIC] Disjointed progression from political theory to historical examples without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] Unclear purpose of the text; it appears to mix political commentary, historical narrative, and art critique without a unifying theme.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs, making the flow of ideas difficult to follow.  
- [CONSISTENCY] Inconsistent focus between social democracy, woman suffrage, and unrelated historical anecdotes.
