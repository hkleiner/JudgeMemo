Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "An exhaustive research into his life and works have revealed..." (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The French arms were knowing defeat." (incorrect verb form)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The only softening influence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing this moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought..." (awkward and overly complex sentence structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was vulgar, until he learned refinement from the distinguished people with whom he was brought into contact..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "There is hardly a 'Lion Comique,' or a lady of the music halls drawing prime minister's salary for songs blatant or obscene..." (awkward and confusing phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "MILLET" in the title is inconsistently capitalized in the text  
- [SPELLING] "Bahá’u’lláh" is spelled correctly, but its inclusion is contextually unclear and seems misplaced  
- [LEXICON] "He was not without jealousy, as may be seen from his pettish condemnation..." (use of "pettish" is uncommon and slightly confusing)  
- [SYNTAX] "It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all, Pieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position..." (awkward and overly wordy)  
- [SYNTAX] "The outlines of the landscape, the very shape of the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ materially in various districts..." (cumbersome phrasing)

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text abruptly shifts from discussing Millet to unrelated topics like Dr. Johnson, Reynolds, and 18th-century English society.  
- [LOGIC] The section about Bahá’u’lláh and translations of his writings is entirely unrelated to the rest of the text and appears out of place.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear narrative flow, with multiple unrelated themes introduced and abandoned.  
- [STRUCTURE] There is no clear thesis or organizing principle, making it difficult to follow the author's intent.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from discussing Millet to discussing Dr. Johnson and Reynolds is abrupt and unexplained.  
- [CLARITY] The purpose of the text is unclear due to the inclusion of irrelevant material and the lack of a central focus.  
- [LOGIC] The text discusses both Dutch and French peasant painters, but the connection between them and Millet is not clearly established.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about "La Baigneuse" and Millet's style is disconnected from the broader discussion and lacks a clear purpose.
