Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The necessary changes would have come about earlier but for the French Revolution and the war. The former caused a panic which now seems to us exaggerated." (Awkward phrasing and unclear reference to "the former")  
- [GRAMMAR] "They did not realise how different the conditions were in the two countries." (Awkward sentence structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The most modest democratic reforms were therefore impossible till Napoleon was out of the way, and till the anti-revolutionary panic had subsided." (Awkward phrasing and repetition of "till")  
- [GRAMMAR] "Mrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been a celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman..." (Overuse of commas and complex structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The twins, who were usually called 'The Star and Stripes,' as they were always getting swished." (Incomplete thought; "swished" is unclear without context)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the whole family went out to drive." (Awkward transition between clauses)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The conversation in no way turned upon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of receptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of psychical phenomena." (Awkward phrasing and overly complex sentence)  
- [GRAMMAR] "It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his pulse, which was not at all feverish." (Sudden shift in tense and tone between sentences)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly from the Otis family's arrival at Canterville Chase to a completely unrelated historical narrative about Bahá’u’lláh and then to Reynolds.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text also shifts to a discussion of Boucher and his artistic development, which is unrelated to the main plot.  
- [LOGIC] The inclusion of unrelated historical and biographical segments (e.g., Bahá’u’lláh, Reynolds, Boucher) disrupts the narrative flow and creates confusion about the central story.  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the Otis family's arrival to the ghost's appearance is jarring, with no clear narrative connection.  
- [TRANSITION] The text lacks smooth transitions between the different segments, making it difficult to follow the intended narrative thread.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
