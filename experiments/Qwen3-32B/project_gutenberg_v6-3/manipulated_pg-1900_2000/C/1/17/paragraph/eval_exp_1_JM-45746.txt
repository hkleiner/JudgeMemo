Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "It must not accept just a mere job" – incorrect use of "must not accept" in context.  
- [GRAMMAR] "Such a confession, however, could be made by many of my associates of fifteen years ago." – awkward phrasing and unclear reference.  
- [SPELLING] "staple national industry" – correct, but "staple" is used in an unusual context.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The time is rapidly drawing to a close when mediocre preparation will be accepted" – awkward phrasing.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The restlessness of the pupils became apparent" – slightly awkward.  
- [GRAMMAR] "I noticed in this bulletin that the correct distance between No. 3 seats is twelve inches" – unclear reference to "No. 3 seats."  
- [GRAMMAR] "She had taught for two years and realized the need of further specialization in her chosen field. To obtain this training, she had spent a year's time." – abrupt ending and redundancy.  
- [SPELLING] "the dean through booklets and suggestive lessons" – missing preposition (e.g., "through the dean").  
- [GRAMMAR] "He said he didn't know just which way the desks should face" – awkward phrasing.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The seating was in bad condition, as little or no care had been taken to keep the proper distance between the desks and the seats." – redundancy and awkward phrasing.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps from the author's personal experience in teaching to historical accounts (e.g., Reynolds, Dean Colet, Boucher) without clear transitions.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves between different time periods and topics (e.g., personal teaching experiences, educational theory, historical vignettes) without a clear organizational structure.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition between the author's experience with school seating and the young man in the agricultural course is abrupt and unclear.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of Reynolds and Boucher seems out of place and unrelated to the central theme of becoming a teacher.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph ("She had taught for two years...") is disconnected from the rest of the text and lacks context.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the boy Boucher" and his historical context is unclear and confusing in the context of the teaching narrative.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of Reynolds in the context of a portrait painter is unrelated to the educational themes of the rest of the text.  
- [LOGIC] The text abruptly shifts from a detailed description of school facilities to historical vignettes and back, disrupting the narrative flow.
