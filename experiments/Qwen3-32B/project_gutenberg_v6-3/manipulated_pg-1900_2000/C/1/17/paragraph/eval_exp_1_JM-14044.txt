Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "There was a thing happened about this time" (awkward phrasing and grammatical error)  
- [SYNTAX] "I have long maintained that on the whole the average church... is a much more poisonous place than the average tavern" (cumbersome sentence structure)  
- [SPELLING] "minutiæ" (archaic spelling may be distracting to some readers)  
- [LEXICON] "aureoled" (rare or archaic word use)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "In the midst of the flame, consumed by it and yet aureoled in it, scattered like ashes and yet triumphant, martyred and for ever glorious." (overly complex and run-on sentence)  
- [SPELLING] "mediævalism" (archaic spelling)  
- [GRAMMAR] "It was at about this period that variants of my tale began to be told as authentic histories" (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "All-Highest" (capitalization inconsistent with surrounding text)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing the origin of "The Bowmen" to the religious philosophy of Bahá’u’lláh (disjointed and confusing transition)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between multiple unrelated themes: art, history, religion, and the legend of the "Angels of Mons" (lack of clear narrative structure)  
- [CLARITY] The author's reflections on his own writing and the legend's evolution are repetitive and meandering (redundant and unclear progression)  
- [TRANSITION] The paragraph about Watteau and Boucher is unrelated to the rest of the text and appears abruptly (poor transition)  
- [LOGIC] The discussion of saints and angels is introduced without sufficient context or connection to the preceding content (confusing to reader)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
