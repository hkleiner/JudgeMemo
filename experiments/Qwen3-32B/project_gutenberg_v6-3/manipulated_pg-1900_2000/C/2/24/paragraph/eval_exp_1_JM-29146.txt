- [LOGIC] The ending shifts abruptly to Ramsey gambling, which is not clearly linked to the prior narrative.  
- [LOGIC] The introduction of the drunken Irwadian at the gambling hall is abrupt and lacks setup.  
- [LOGIC] The anthropologist's anecdote about Irwadian clothing is inserted without clear relevance to the main narrative.
