Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The phenomenon is one that has no reference points in the contemporary world, but is associated rather with..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "Muḥammad" (rare but non-standard spelling, may confuse readers unfamiliar with transliteration conventions)  
- [SYNTAX] "A keyboard clicked without being touched" (sudden, disconnected sentence with unclear relevance)  
- [SYNTAX] "A hologram displayed the weather" (sudden, disconnected sentence with unclear relevance)  
- [SYNTAX] "A bluetooth signal was detected" (sudden, disconnected sentence with unclear relevance)  
- [LEXICON] "galling weight of the chains" (somewhat archaic or obscure phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unrelated sentences such as "A keyboard clicked without being touched" and "A hologram displayed the weather" disrupt the logical flow of the narrative.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text transitions smoothly for the most part, but the inclusion of unrelated technical or metaphorical sentences breaks the narrative cohesion.  
- [CLARITY] Some abstract concepts (e.g., "the impulse behind a process of social transformation") are introduced without sufficient elaboration.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the discussion of Bahá’u’lláh’s early life to the unrelated sentences is abrupt and jarring.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
