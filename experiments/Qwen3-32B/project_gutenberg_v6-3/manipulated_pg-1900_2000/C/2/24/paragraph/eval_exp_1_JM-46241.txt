Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "mediæval" appears inconsistently with "medieval" in later parts.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences, e.g., "the first part of which was printed in 1471; but, as the most important from the artistic point of view..."  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in sentences such as "the names under which the Ulm and Augsburg picture-books are known are all those of their printers."  
- [SPELLING] "A self-driving cart turned left." is an unrelated sentence fragment.  
- [SPELLING] "A soundbar adjusted volume automatically." is another unrelated sentence fragment.  
- [SPELLING] "A voice command triggered automation." is another unrelated sentence fragment.  
- [SYNTAX] Repetition of phrases like "undated but probably" and "undated but about" without variation.  
- [SPELLING] "mediæval" is archaic and inconsistent with modern usage of "medieval."  
- [SPELLING] "c." is used inconsistently in dates, e.g., "c. 1471" vs. "1471."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden and unrelated sentence fragments such as "A self-driving cart turned left." and "A voice command triggered automation." disrupt the flow and logic of the text.  
- [STRUCTURE] The article is well-structured in general, but the presence of unrelated sentences breaks the narrative flow and logical progression.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and could benefit from clearer phrasing, e.g., "the names under which the Ulm and Augsburg picture-books are known are all those of their printers."  
- [TRANSITION] Some transitions between paragraphs and ideas are abrupt, particularly when moving from one printer or book to another.  
- [LOGIC] The article is largely coherent in its focus on early woodcut books and illuminated manuscripts, but the inclusion of unrelated sentences creates confusion.
