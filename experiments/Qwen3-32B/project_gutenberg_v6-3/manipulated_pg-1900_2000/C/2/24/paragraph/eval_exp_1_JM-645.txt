Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing punctuation in some sentences, especially after em dashes and colons.  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in phrases like “I had fancied him reading it with relish, but if Corvick wasn’t satisfied how could Vereker himself be?”  
- [LEXICON] Some phrases are overly complex or archaic, potentially confusing modern readers.  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor grammatical issues in phrases like “He had showed me Gwendolen’s photograph with the remark that she wasn’t pretty but was awfully interesting.”  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected, but some punctuation and phrasing issues may distract.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between past and present without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] Some character motivations are unclear, such as Corvick’s sudden urgency to go to Paris.  
- [CLARITY] The protagonist’s internal thoughts and emotions are not always clearly explained, making the narrative feel detached.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts in focus between characters and events, such as the sudden introduction of the diagnostic tool and ambient music.  
- [CONSISTENCY] The tone shifts between literary and modern, with some technological references (e.g., retinal implant) that feel out of place in the otherwise 19th-century setting.
