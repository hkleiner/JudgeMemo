Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The reign of Queen Victoria, which I have chosen to mark the limits of my survey to-day, covered the latter half of this saeculum mirabile, the most wonderful century in human history. A touchscreen panel showed static." (sudden unrelated phrase at the end)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The 3D printer finished the replica." (sudden unrelated phrase at the end)  
- [GRAMMAR] "raised with an ease." (incomplete or awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "waggon" (non-standard spelling; should be "wagon")  
- [SPELLING] "waggon-loads" (non-standard spelling; should be "wagon-loads")  
- [SYNTAX] "It had the double effect of pauperising the rural labourer and of putting an artificial premium on large families--the children who were carted off in waggon-loads to feed the factories." (awkward phrasing and structure)  
- [LEXICON] "The country was, in vulgar language, a going concern, as it never was before and has not been since." (unusual and slightly jarring phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden and unrelated phrases at the end of paragraphs (e.g., "A touchscreen panel showed static," "The 3D printer finished the replica") disrupt the flow and logical structure.  
- [LOGIC] The text abruptly shifts from historical analysis to modern technology at the end of paragraphs, creating confusion about the intended focus.  
- [TRANSITION] Some transitions between paragraphs are weak or absent, making the progression of ideas less smooth.  
- [CLARITY] The sentence "We are always sowing our future; we are always reaping our past." is abstract and could be clearer in its connection to the historical narrative.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text sometimes introduces a historical point and then shifts to a different topic without clear connection or conclusion.
