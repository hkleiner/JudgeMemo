1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The squirrels have given me the greatest evidence of the capacity for humanisation, and, at the same time, of such intellectual powers as are within the limited range of the creatures we call brute."  
- [GRAMMAR] "the vulgaris being that which wins closest to the heart of the lover of animals"  
- [GRAMMAR] "The numerous expressions of pleasure at the reading of my history of two pet squirrels, printed in the Century Magazine several years ago, persuaded me that in a more permanent and convenient form it may serve still further the purpose for which it was written"  
- [GRAMMAR] "But the early experiences of my own life, gained in a country and under circumstances in which the killing of wild creatures was often the necessary means of obtaining food, and the recognition of the unquestionable utility of field sports as contributing to the greater health, mental and physical, of men, forbid me to join in an undiscriminating crusade against those field sports"  
- [GRAMMAR] "I do not discuss the question; I feel for myself, and conform my own conduct to my feelings, without pretending to prescribe for others."  
- [GRAMMAR] "My Hans in his eagerness to escape would probably have gone to a speedy death—with me he had a sure protection"  
- [GRAMMAR] "The energy grid remained balanced."  
- [GRAMMAR] "A drone swarm aligned in formation."  
- [GRAMMAR] "A scanner swept the room once."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden and irrelevant statements like "The energy grid remained balanced" and "A drone swarm aligned in formation" disrupt the logical flow of the narrative.  
- [LOGIC] The introduction of a quote from a gamekeeper is abruptly followed by unrelated sentences.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between abstract philosophical reflections, personal anecdotes, and factual statements without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The author’s stance on animal captivity and the moral responsibility of humans is not consistently maintained, leading to confusion.  
- [TRANSITION] There is a lack of clear transitions between paragraphs and ideas, making it difficult to follow the progression of the argument.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
