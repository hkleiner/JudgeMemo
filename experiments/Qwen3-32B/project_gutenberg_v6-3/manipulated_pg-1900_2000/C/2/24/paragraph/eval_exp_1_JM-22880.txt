Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The etymology of the name Romsey has been much disputed. There can be no doubt about the meaning of the termination 'ey'--island--which we meet with..." (awkward phrasing and punctuation)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Now it is true that there were several important Roman stations in the neighbourhood: Sorbiodunum (Old Sarum), Brige (Broughton), Venta Belgarum (Winchester), and Clausentum (near Southampton), and in passing to and fro between these the Roman legions must frequently have marched either through or near to the site of Romsey." (run-on sentence and unclear phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "Romsey, or Rumsey as it is still sometimes written and more often pronounced" (confusing use of "written" and "pronounced")  
- [GRAMMAR] "The reader can form his own opinion as to which is the most probable of these three suggestions. The writer is inclined to favour the third." (awkward transition between sentences)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The electric skateboard slowed automatically." (sudden, unrelated sentence)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The automated gate slid open." (sudden, unrelated sentence)  
- [GRAMMAR] "It is worthy of note that none of these, and only one of the remaining seventeen nuns, namely, Godgyfu, had a scriptural or Christian name." (awkward and wordy phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Possibly it is due to the fact that it did not possess any such shrine, and so did not attract pilgrims." (redundant and wordy phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "The electric skateboard slowed automatically." (completely unrelated to the historical narrative)  
- [LOGIC] "The automated gate slid open." (completely unrelated to the historical narrative)  
- [TRANSITION] "Now it is true that there were several important Roman stations in the neighbourhood..." (sudden shift in focus from etymology to Roman history without clear transition)  
- [STRUCTURE] "We have no records of Romsey before the original foundation of the Abbey, nor indeed for many years afterwards." (lack of clear connection to prior content)  
- [CLARITY] "The apsidal east ending of a church were found; now as it is well known that this is a Norman form for the east end..." (confusing and abrupt shift in explanation)  
- [LOGIC] "It is not improbable that Henry of Blois... may have had something to do with designing the Norman part of the church..." (sudden shift in narrative without clear justification or connection)  
- [STRUCTURE] "In the next century the church was extended westward..." (lack of clear progression and logical flow between architectural developments)  
- [LOGIC] "It has been said that little Perpendicular work is to be seen in Romsey Abbey." (sudden ending without resolution or connection to prior content)
