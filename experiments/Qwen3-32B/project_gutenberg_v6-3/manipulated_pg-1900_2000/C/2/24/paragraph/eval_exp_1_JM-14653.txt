Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or inconsistent punctuation in some sentences.  
- [SPELLING] Minor spelling inconsistencies or errors (e.g., "larked" could be ambiguous).  
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and complex, making them slightly harder to parse.  
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or stylistic word choices may be less common, but not necessarily incorrect.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition between the first and second chapters is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [LOGIC] The introduction of modern technology (e.g., "Notifications appeared on the smartwatch") is jarring and disrupts the narrative flow.  
- [CLARITY] The shift in tone from nostalgic reflection to scientific critique is not well-signaled, making the overall message less unified.  
- [TRANSITION] Some paragraphs begin without clear links to the previous content, leading to minor confusion in the narrative progression.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
