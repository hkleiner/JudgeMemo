1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "the tipstaff to the king's palace, one François Prévost, signed solemnly as witness to the birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather..." (awkward phrasing and misplaced modifiers)  
- [SPELLING] "morsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black and white for ever..." (incorrect use of "set forth" in this context)  
- [SYNTAX] "A contactless payment completed." (fragmented sentence with no context)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The auto-tuner adjusted the sound levels." (fragmented sentence with no context)  
- [GRAMMAR] "There was a thing happened about this time..." (incorrect structure)  
- [SYNTAX] "He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as were to his taste..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like the three years' conventional Italian study..." (awkward phrasing and unclear punctuation)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He won them; for, in this his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris." (sentence fragment, incomplete thought)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "A contactless payment completed." (irrelevant and disconnected from the narrative)  
- [LOGIC] "The auto-tuner adjusted the sound levels." (irrelevant and disconnected from the narrative)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly between historical narration and modern anachronisms (e.g., contactless payment, phone ringing) without explanation or context  
- [CLARITY] The narrative abruptly shifts between detailed historical descriptions and modern, out-of-place sentences, disrupting the flow and reader immersion  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between the birth narrative and unrelated anachronistic events  
- [LOGIC] The inclusion of anachronisms (e.g., phone ringing) breaks the historical realism and logical progression of the text
