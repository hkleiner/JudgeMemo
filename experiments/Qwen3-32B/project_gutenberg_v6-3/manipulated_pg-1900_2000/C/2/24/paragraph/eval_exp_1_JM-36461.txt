- [LOGIC] Inconsistencies in the timeline and events (e.g., unclear transitions between Hannah Snellâ€™s life and the genealogical background).  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references and unclear pronoun usage (e.g., "this Deponent" repeated without clear antecedent).  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs and ideas, leading to confusion.  
- [AMBIGUITY] Confusing or unclear sentence structures that hinder understanding (e.g., "and which not only placed them above Contempt, but also enabled them to bring up, and educate a numerous Family").
