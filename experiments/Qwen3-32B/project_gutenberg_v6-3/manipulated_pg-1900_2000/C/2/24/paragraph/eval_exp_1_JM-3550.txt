Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or incorrect punctuation in some sentences  
- [SPELLING] "eau sucré" likely should be "eau sucrée" (sugar water)  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "The AI core recalibrated the system" and "The smart paper displayed new text"  
- [LEXICON] Use of "peregrinations" and "pooh-pooh" may be considered overly archaic or obscure for modern fluency  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden appearance of "The AI core recalibrated the system" and "The smart paper displayed new text" disrupts narrative flow  
- [STRUCTURE] These out-of-place sentences break the otherwise consistent narrative style  
- [TRANSITION] No clear transition between the historical narrative and the modern AI references  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
