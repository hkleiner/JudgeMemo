- [SPELLING] "A home pod switched tracks." (likely a typo or hallucination with no clear meaning)  
- [SYNTAX] "The two jobbers are kicked." (awkward phrasing with unclear meaning)  
- [LEXICON] "The drone docked without issue." (vague and out of context, likely a hallucination)  
- [SYNTAX] "You donâ€™t like arithmetic, anyway." (awkward and stylistically inconsistent with the rest of the text)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "The laser display turned off automatically." (irrelevant to the narrative and disrupts the flow)  
- [LOGIC] "A home pod switched tracks." (completely out of context and disrupts the narrative logic)  
- [LOGIC] "The drone docked without issue." (nonsensical in the context of a historical narrative about a boy printer)  
- [LOGIC] "The two jobbers are kicked." (unclear reference that breaks the narrative logic)  
- [LOGIC] "The laser display turned off automatically." and "A home pod switched tracks" (these sentences appear to be hallucinations and have no place in the historical narrative)
