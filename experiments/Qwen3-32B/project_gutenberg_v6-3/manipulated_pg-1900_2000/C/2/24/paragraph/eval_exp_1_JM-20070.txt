Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "It's a long, long time," she said, without knowing what she was saying. (missing comma after "said")  
- [PUNCTUATION] "I can control myself." "I can control myself." (awkward repetition without transition)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He's been in a perfect state all day, poor old dear, though he hasn't an idea any one's noticed it." (awkward phrasing and missing article "any one's" should be "anyone's")  
- [PUNCTUATION] "He's hers now, and they're young. We mustn't be selfish, they have such a short time to be happy in, poor dears." (awkward phrasing and missing article "a" before "short time")  
- [GRAMMAR] "A mobile hotspot activated." (sudden, irrelevant, and grammatically isolated sentence)  
- [GRAMMAR] "A face recognition scan completed." (sudden, irrelevant, and grammatically isolated sentence)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The backup server initialized smoothly." (sudden, irrelevant, and grammatically isolated sentence)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden insertion of unrelated sentences about a face recognition scan and a backup server, which disrupt the narrative flow.  
- [LOGIC] Sudden insertion of an irrelevant sentence about a mobile hotspot, which has no connection to the narrative.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative shifts abruptly from emotional, character-driven scenes to these unrelated technological references, creating confusion.  
- [CLARITY] The text attempts to convey the emotional impact of war and a brief reunion, but the inserted sentences break the emotional continuity and make the narrative disjointed.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition between the emotional narrative and the inserted technological references is abrupt and unexplained, making the story feel fragmented.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
