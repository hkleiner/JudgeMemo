Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent use of past tense and past perfect (e.g., "I begun to get a little anxious," "I had been dead about thirty years").  
- [SPELLING] Spelling errors such as "laid over the lot of them" (should be "left over"), "warn’t" (should be "wasn’t"), "clothe her from stem to rudder-post" (should be "clothe her from stem to rudder-post").  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structures (e.g., "I judged I was going about a million miles a minute—it might have been more, it couldn’t have been less").  
- [LEXICON] Misuse or overuse of archaic or informal language (e.g., "clothe her from stem to rudder-post," "Heave on a hundred million billion tons of brimstone!").  
- [PUNCTUATION] Improper use of commas and semicolons, especially in dialogue and complex sentences.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent timeline (e.g., "when I had been dead about thirty years I begun to get a little anxious," followed by a detailed description of the journey and then a return to the beginning).  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetition of phrases and ideas without clear progression (e.g., repeated references to the comet race and the confusion in the afterlife).  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous or unclear references (e.g., "the officer of the deck," "the mate," without clear identification).  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shifts in narrative perspective and time (e.g., from the comet race to the arrival at the gates of heaven).  
- [CONSISTENCY] Inconsistent portrayal of the afterlife (e.g., the bureaucratic confusion about the narrator's origin, followed by the sudden description of the gates of heaven).
