Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "An exhaustive research into his life and works have revealed..." (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The two figures in the foreground are symbolical of..." (awkward phrasing; "symbolical" is uncommon and stylistically weak)  
- [SPELLING] "A proximity alert sounded once." (irrelevant and out of place, likely a typo or error)  
- [SPELLING] "The iPhone was fully charged now." (irrelevant and out of place, likely a typo or error)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The drone’s camera swiveled silently." (irrelevant and out of place, likely a typo or error)  
- [GRAMMAR] "By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a large and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the 'Sawyers,' he has attained an astonishing degree of power." (awkward and overly wordy)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Not only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very numerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a man who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life." (awkward phrasing and missing subject)  
- [SPELLING] "ménage" (though technically correct, it is rare and could be confusing to a general reader)  
- [GRAMMAR] "You must have studied the country he has chosen to depict." (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "A proximity alert sounded once." (irrelevant and disrupts the narrative flow)  
- [LOGIC] "The iPhone was fully charged now." (irrelevant and disrupts the narrative flow)  
- [LOGIC] "The drone’s camera swiveled silently." (irrelevant and disrupts the narrative flow)  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shifts in tone and subject matter, particularly in the middle of the text, where the narrative abruptly changes focus without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The text occasionally uses overly complex and archaic language, which may confuse readers and hinder clarity.  
- [STRUCTURE] The essay lacks a clear thesis or organizing principle, making it difficult to follow the author’s main argument about Millet’s place in the history of peasant painting.  
- [LOGIC] The essay jumps between historical context, analysis of Millet’s work, and philosophical musings without clear connections or transitions.
