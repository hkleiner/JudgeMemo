- [LOGIC] The narrative shifts from Hannah Snell's oath to a general reflection on heroism and then back to her family history without clear connection  
- [CLARITY] Some sections are overly verbose and difficult to follow (e.g., the long historical reflection on heroism)  
- [TRANSITION] Poor transitions between paragraphs and sections create disjointed reading experience  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about Hannah's grandfather is detailed but lacks clear relevance to her personal story in some parts
