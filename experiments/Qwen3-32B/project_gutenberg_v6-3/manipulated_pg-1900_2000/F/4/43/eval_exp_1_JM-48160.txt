- [GRAMMAR] "One passes, also, hundreds of military trains, out of whose windows are hanging rows of soldiers in “horizon blue.”" (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different time points and locations without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The text mentions the author’s attempt to get to the front, but the process is described in a confusing and disjointed manner.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences, particularly in the middle of the text, are unclear and do not effectively convey the author’s intent.  
- [TRANSITION] There are abrupt shifts between topics, such as from the author’s attempts to gain permission to visit the front to descriptions of cemeteries and soldiers.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative lacks a clear progression from one event to the next, making it difficult to follow the author’s journey and motivations.
