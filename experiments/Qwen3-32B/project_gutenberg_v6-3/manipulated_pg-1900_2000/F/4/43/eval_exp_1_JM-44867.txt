Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The of obey would it legal the mind sacrifice would, the past creative unhesitatingly type to unhesitatingly the future." (awkward and grammatically incorrect sentence)  
- [GRAMMAR] "In two work looking equally out affairs incompatible of things divergent ways at also public sphere into the and these of consequences." (fragmented and ungrammatical)  
- [SPELLING] "Ã¦sthetic" (archaic spelling, though not an error, it may be considered inconsistent with modern usage)  
- [SYNTAX] "The yet says to here things creative mind we have be because are." (incoherent syntax)  
- [SYNTAX] "Things have been, says the legal mind, and so we are here." (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "In two work looking equally out affairs incompatible of things divergent ways at also public sphere into the and these of consequences." (illogical and disconnected from the main argument)  
- [STRUCTURE] The essay shifts abruptly from abstract concepts to specific examples (e.g., wars, promises) without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] "The yet says to here things creative mind we have be because are." (meaning is unclear and disrupts the flow)  
- [TRANSITION] The final paragraph introduces new ideas (e.g., wars, South Africa) without sufficient contextual transition.  
- [LOGIC] The discussion of moral compromise is introduced suddenly and not clearly connected to the earlier argument about mind types.
