- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas and quotation marks in dialogue sections.  
- [SPELLING] "visage" instead of "face" (though correct, it is uncommon and may be considered awkward phrasing).  
- [SYNTAX] "He was that kind of a friendly young man who is naturally gay-hearted and also a little curious--sometimes to the verge of indiscretion." (awkward phrasing).  
- [LEXICON] "visage" is an unusual word in this context and may disrupt natural phrasing.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The sentence "The scarcely valise rear at he the had driving and the spokenwho the rickety of to was railroad Marche since boy 's cases strapped gun wagon station." is incoherent and disrupts the flow of the narrative.  
- [STRUCTURE] The sentence "The heavily most most the region a decoys the, for in was far in-Island their and for the was clubhouse; Club their entire shanty as as two simplicity Foam of concerned but one, island of the cared went and story trained perfectly desirable live." is incoherent and makes the narrative difficult to follow.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative suddenly jumps from Marche's thoughts about the club to the description of the room and then to the girl, creating a disjointed reading experience.  
- [LOGIC] The sentence "For curiosity his are when his was less a-is situated he fiction--it than favorite aroused men particularly were fortunately interest in all easily a that where inquiring in fellow world and they created equal." is incoherent and disrupts the narrative.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the dinner scene to the business discussion is abrupt and lacks smooth connection.  
- [CLARITY] The sentence "Do too expensive you think it was?" is grammatically incorrect and unclear in meaning.
