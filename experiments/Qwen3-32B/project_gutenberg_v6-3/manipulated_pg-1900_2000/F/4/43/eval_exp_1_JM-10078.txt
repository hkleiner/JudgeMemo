1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "It inquire to to, therefore, whether American has even press attempt not it Government if or not public to dare desired, so, would necessary since attack employed make the, it instigated the the is do Germany." (fragmented and incoherent sentence structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "If, to, careful to to really observe to under describe my conditions accuracy conduct wantin American opinion you Germany, I same scientific 's the been will with the calmness formed earnestly which I them therefore which endeavour has of and attention endeavour know investigations." (grammatically incorrect and incoherent)

- [SYNTAX] "In were, favourite of two chums my one professors of German and college one college my of parentage." (disjointed and ungrammatical)  
- [SYNTAX] "Your and were, enclosed clippings with postal, newspaper two duly your card letters received." (awkward and ungrammatical phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text shifts abruptly from personal reflections on Germany to detailed critiques of press freedom, with little transitional support.  
- [CLARITY] The argument about press freedom is undermined by later incoherent and grammatically broken sentences, confusing the reader.  
- [STRUCTURE] The final paragraph of the main body is incoherent and fails to convey the intended logical progression.  
- [TRANSITION] There is a lack of smooth transitions between the different topics, such as from personal anecdotes to political critique.  
- [LOGIC] The conclusion attempts to summarize the purpose of the letter, but the prior incoherence weakens the overall logical structure.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
