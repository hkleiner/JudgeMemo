2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The narrative shifts abruptly from philosophical conversation in the conservatory to Diotti's emotional reaction after the concert without clear transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps from the concert scene back to Perkins in the morning without clear temporal or logical connection.  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of the mangled sentence "prepared you the to accept must and of be man But work his violinist" is unclear and disrupts the flow.  
- [LOGIC] The philosophical dialogue between Diotti and Miss Wallace is lengthy and dense, but lacks a clear resolution or connection to the main narrative.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the concert scene to Diotti's emotional breakdown in his hotel room is abrupt and lacks sufficient emotional buildup.
