(awkward phrasing and excessive punctuation)  
- [GRAMMAR] "But the days passed, and no spirit having stirred the venerated bones of the wonder-working saint, on June 10 judgment was given in favour of Henry..." (awkward and unclear structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "And the imminence of further change carries with it no danger of any break in this long association of Canterbury with ecclesiastical control..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "archÃ¦ologists" (incorrect character encoding)

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph is completely incoherent and does not contribute to the narrative or argument of the text.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the historical narrative to the incoherent final paragraph is jarring and disrupts the flow of the text.  
- [CLARITY] The passage about the Roman roads and Durovernum is dense and lacks clear progression, making it difficult to follow.  
- [LOGIC] The text abruptly shifts from discussing the medieval pilgrimages to the Roman and Saxon history of Canterbury without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about St. Martin's church is confusing and lacks a clear argument or logical sequence.
