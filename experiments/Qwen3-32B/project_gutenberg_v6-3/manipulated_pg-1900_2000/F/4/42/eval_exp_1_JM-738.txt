2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The introduction jumps between abstract literary critique and biographical details without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The transition from discussing Dickens’s health to the plot of *The Mystery of Edwin Drood* is abrupt and lacks context.  
- [CLARITY] The purpose of the chapter is unclear in the introduction—readers may not know if it is a literary analysis, a biography, or a mystery-solving attempt.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of characters like Mr. Honeythunder and Miss Twinkleton is confusing without prior context.  
- [STRUCTURE] The section on the dramatis personae is detailed but lacks integration with the rest of the text.  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the dramatis personae to the opening of the tale is abrupt and lacks narrative flow.  
- [CLARITY] Some descriptions of characters and their relationships are ambiguous or overly condensed.  
- [LOGIC] The shift from character descriptions to the analysis of the opium den and Jasper’s vision is disjointed.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "The Signalman" is unclear in its relevance to *Edwin Drood*.  
- [LOGIC] The conclusion of the introduction ("With this brief preface, I proceeded...") is confusing as it suggests the author is moving forward, but the text does not follow through immediately.
