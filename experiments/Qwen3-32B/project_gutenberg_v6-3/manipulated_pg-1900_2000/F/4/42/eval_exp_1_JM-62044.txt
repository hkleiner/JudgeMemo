- [CLARITY] The author's position on the ethics of keeping animals is unclear and sometimes contradictory (e.g., condemning cages but advocating domestication).  
- [TRANSITION] Sentences and paragraphs often begin without clear reference to the previous idea, making the flow of thought difficult to follow.  
- [LOGIC] The argument that love for animals increases capacity for love in general is presented without sufficient support or development.  
- [LOGIC] The shift from discussing squirrels to human charity and then back to squirrels is disjointed and lacks cohesion.
