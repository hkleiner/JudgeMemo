Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "I could not agree with your opinions regarding Germany's responsibility for the war, nor regarding her methods of conducting the war" (awkward phrasing with double "regarding")  
- [GRAMMAR] "I believe that in a calmer time you would not entertain the sweeping opinion" (subject-verb agreement issue)  
- [SPELLING] "knew" should be "know" in "demand to knew the truth"  
- [GRAMMAR] "woulded be hotly resented" (incorrect verb form)  
- [GRAMMAR] "to inquired whether the American Government has employed" (incorrect verb form)  
- [GRAMMAR] "to dwelt upon this phase of your correspondence" (incorrect verb form)  
- [GRAMMAR] "returned the courtesy" (incorrect verb form)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is a formal letter but lacks clear paragraph breaks and section divisions, making it hard to follow the logical flow.  
- [LOGIC] The argument transitions abruptly from acknowledging the emotional state of the reader to detailed critiques of the press, creating a disjointed impression.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and complex, which obscures the intended meaning and makes it difficult to follow the argument.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the letter's personal tone to the analytical section on public opinion is abrupt and lacks a smooth transition.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
