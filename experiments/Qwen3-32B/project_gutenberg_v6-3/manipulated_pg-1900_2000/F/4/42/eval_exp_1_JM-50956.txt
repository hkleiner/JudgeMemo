- [GRAMMAR] "that it should had been anticipated"  
- [GRAMMAR] "Russia could had occupied Galicia and East Prussia had the Austrian Army left for France."  
- [GRAMMAR] "they would had had these troops at their disposal"  
- [GRAMMAR] "It is the recognition of these facts that should prompted every impartial historian..."

- [SPELLING] "Joffre's condition would have been rendered critical" (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "the final catastrophe of the Central Powers was the direct consequence of the offensive of the Allies in 1918, but Russia made possible this collapse to a considerable degree" (awkward and repetitive)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text shifts abruptly between historical analysis and polemical statements without clear transitions.  
- [STRUCTURE] The argument is repetitive, especially in emphasizing Russia's role without sufficient variation in structure or evidence.  
- [CLARITY] Some statements are vague or overly generalized, such as "the sanguine World struggle," which hinders clarity.  
- [LOGIC] The author attempts to refute Ludendorf's memoirs but does so without providing concrete counter-evidence, weakening the argument's coherence.  
- [TRANSITION] There are few transitional phrases to guide the reader between the introduction and the analytical section, making the flow disjointed.  
- [LOGIC] The conclusion reiterates earlier points without adding new insights, which diminishes the overall logical progression of the text.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
