- [STRUCTURE] The second chapter abruptly begins with "If the decadence of Christmas were a purely subjective phenomenon" without clear connection to the first chapter  
- [CLARITY] Some abstract philosophical arguments are dense and may confuse readers unfamiliar with the historical context of 19th-century scientific skepticism
