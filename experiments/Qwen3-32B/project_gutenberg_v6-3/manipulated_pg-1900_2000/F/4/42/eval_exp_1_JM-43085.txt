1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "he had to achieve a living" (should be "make a living")  
- [GRAMMAR] "His father spare him an allowance" (should be "His father spared him an allowance")  
- [GRAMMAR] "it was not long afterwards, thanks to a dogged persistence" (awkward phrasing; "thanks to his dogged persistence" is more natural)  
- [GRAMMAR] "he have begotten an artist" (should be "he had begotten an artist")  
- [GRAMMAR] "it was not that he did not want to, or had not cherished the dream of doing so" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The influence of antiquity, so perceptible in the language as well as in the manners and fashions at the close of the Eighteenth Century, serve only to confine..." (subject-verb agreement error; "served" is needed)  
- [SPELLING] "took on a rather bitter tone" (should be "taken on a rather bitter tone")  
- [SPELLING] "The press, the art clubs, not to mention the salons, were all more or less divided between the romantics and the classicists, the innovators and the traditionalists, and fanned the flames of a quarrel which, in view of the worth of the two leaders--one of whom spell genius and the other perfection--was destined..." (should be "spelled genius")

- [SPELLING] "I will not said in miniature" (should be "I will not say in miniature")

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between Meissonier's artistic development and broader historical context without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] Some sentences introduce ideas abruptly without sufficient setup, such as the sudden mention of "The Expedition into Egypt" without clear connection to Meissonier's activities.  
- [CLARITY] The text occasionally uses overly complex or archaic phrasing that hinders clarity, such as "Be one's tastes never so modest, it is difficult under such conditions to make both ends meet."  
- [TRANSITION] Some paragraphs transition abruptly, making it difficult to follow the progression of ideas.  
- [CLARITY] The sentence structure in some parts is overly convoluted, such as: "The press, the art clubs, not to mention the salons, were all more or less divided between the romantics and the classicists, the innovators and the traditionalists, and fanned the flames of a quarrel..."
