- [PUNCTUATION] Missing punctuation in long sentences (e.g., "He was that kind of a friendly young man who is naturally gay-hearted and also a little curious--sometimes to the verge of indiscretion. For his curiosity and inquiring interest in his fellow-men was easily aroused--particularly when they were less fortunately situated than he in a world where it is a favorite fiction that all are created equal.")  
- [SPELLING] "visage" used instead of "face" (not incorrect, but unusual phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "muddy island which had once been the property of a club consisting of five carefully selected and wealthy members, and which, through death and resignation, had now reverted to him. Why he had ever bought in the shares, as one by one the other members either died or drop out, he did not exactly know." (mixed tense in "drop out")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative shifts abruptly from descriptive setting to character dialogue and back without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The motivations and background of Marche are introduced in a fragmented manner, making it hard to follow his purpose for being on the island.  
- [LOGIC] The relationship between Marche and the Herold family is unclear at first and only gradually revealed.  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the business discussion to the personal conversation is abrupt and lacks smooth flow.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of Jim's education and Latin grammar is introduced suddenly and seems disconnected from the main narrative thread.  
- [CLARITY] Some phrases are ambiguous or require rereading for clarity (e.g., "the solemn rumor of the sea, muttering of wrecks and death along the Atlantic sands beyond the inland sounds").
