- [GRAMMAR] "his world-famous shrine overlay with gold..." – incorrect verb form ("overlay" should be "overlaid").  
- [GRAMMAR] "they was less devout..." – subject-verb agreement error.  
- [GRAMMAR] "who for century after century feasted..." – missing article ("the century after century").  
- [SPELLING] "Now, I do not disguised..." – incorrect verb form ("disguised" should be "disguise").

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps abruptly from historical events to modern pilgrims without smooth transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] The first chapter mixes historical events with commentary on modern pilgrims, creating a disjointed structure.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and complex, making the meaning difficult to follow.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from medieval history to Roman and prehistoric history lacks clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The discussion of St. Martin's church and its origins is introduced abruptly and not clearly connected to the main narrative.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "the most convenient, rapid, and comfortable method of travel then available" is ambiguous and could refer to multiple things.
