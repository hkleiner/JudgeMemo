2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different time periods without clear transitions (e.g., from the 1821-1822 events to the 1830 revolution and then to 1832 cholera outbreak).  
- [LOGIC] The connection between Rosa's early artistic inclinations and her later career is not explicitly drawn, leaving the progression of her development somewhat unclear.  
- [CLARITY] The text occasionally presents events in a fragmented manner, such as the frequent relocations of the Bonheur family without clear motivation or consequences.  
- [TRANSITION] There are abrupt shifts between Rosa's childhood experiences and her later years of study and success, without sufficient contextual linkage.  
- [LOGIC] The text mentions the death of Mme. Bonheur but does not clearly establish how this event impacts the family's circumstances or Rosa's development.
