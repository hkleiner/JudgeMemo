- [GRAMMAR] "died on the first day of Passover, 1906" should be "died on the first day of Passover in 1906"  
- [GRAMMAR] "which am dead or dying" should be "which are dead or dying"  
- [GRAMMAR] "not fully understand" should be "not fully understood"  
- [GRAMMAR] "to was delivered to-day by the most distinguished of lived Jewish men of letters" should be "to be delivered to-day by the most distinguished of living Jewish men of letters"  
- [GRAMMAR] "David, who is promised of God that his seed shall was enthroned for ever" should be "David, who is promised by God that his seed shall be enthroned for ever"  
- [GRAMMAR] "Every Saturday night the orthodox Jew repeated the prayer" should be "Every Saturday night the orthodox Jew repeats the prayer"  
- [GRAMMAR] "Pursue them in anger and destroy them from under the heavens of the Lord!" should be "Pursue them in anger and destroy them from under the heavens of the Lord!" (punctuation only, but missing period)  
- [SPELLING] "Hebrewism" used instead of "Germanism" in one instance  
- [SPELLING] "Deutsche Religion" should be "Deutsche Religion" (not an issue, but the capitalization may be inconsistent)  
- [SPELLING] "Verhaeren" is misspelled as "Vehaeren"  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from biographical details of Arthur Davis to a broader discussion of Hebrew and ritual languages, with minimal transitional cues.  
- [LOGIC] The shift from discussing Arthur Davis's life and work to the broader topic of the "Chosen People" is not clearly connected, leading to a disjointed structure.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the foreword to Chapter I is abrupt and lacks context, making it unclear how the content in Chapter I relates to the introduction.  
- [CLARITY] The argument in Chapter I is repetitive and lacks a clear progression, especially in the accumulation of examples of Jewish and German "chosenness" without synthesis.  
- [LOGIC] The text occasionally introduces ideas without sufficient explanation or context, such as the comparison between Hebrew and other ritual languages, which is not fully developed.
