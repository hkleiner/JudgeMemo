- [LOGIC] The section on substitutes for allspice includes a long list without clear organization or logical grouping.  
- [LOGIC] The description of capsicum varieties is lengthy and repetitive, with some entries overlapping or unclear in purpose.  
- [LOGIC] The section on cinnamon and cassia includes a confusing mix of historical, botanical, and commercial information without clear progression.  
- [LOGIC] Some paragraphs are overly detailed about specific varieties without connecting them to the broader topic.  
- [LOGIC] The text occasionally introduces new concepts (e.g., "Tabasco pepper sauce") without sufficient background or context.
