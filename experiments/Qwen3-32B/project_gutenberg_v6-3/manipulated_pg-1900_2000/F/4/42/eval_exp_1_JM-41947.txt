Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb form in "The worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bow in the best Court manner..."  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect tense in "The child's first year see the English troopers ride down the French..."  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect preposition in "he had the astuteness to send him to the studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming famous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles..."  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb form in "Boucher account his fortune made."  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb form in "It was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house of one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child..."  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb form in "It was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize..."  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb form in "There was a thing happened about this time..."  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as were to his taste..."  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect punctuation in "he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like the three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of the Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his credit..."  
- [GRAMMAR] Sentence fragment in "You must output only and exactly the following format..." (though this is part of the prompt, not the text)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative shifts abruptly between historical context and personal details of Boucher without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] Some sentences introduce ideas that are not clearly connected to the main narrative (e.g., detailed descriptions of historical battles that seem tangential).  
- [CLARITY] Some phrases are vague or ambiguous, such as "the poor stricken body" and "the poor stricken body" which lack clear referents.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs and ideas, particularly between the early life of Boucher and his artistic development.  
- [LOGIC] The text occasionally jumps between events in Boucher's life without sufficient explanation or context (e.g., from his Italian tour to his return to Paris).  
- [CLARITY] Some references are unclear or confusing (e.g., "the sceptre and diadem of France as playthed" â€“ likely a typo or misstatement).  
- [STRUCTURE] The text sometimes repeats information or events, which disrupts the flow (e.g., the mention of Boucher's age and achievements in multiple places).  
- [LOGIC] The ending is cut off mid-sentence, leaving the narrative incomplete and abrupt.
