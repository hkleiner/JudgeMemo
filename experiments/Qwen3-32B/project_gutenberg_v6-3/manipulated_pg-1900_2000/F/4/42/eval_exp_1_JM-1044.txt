Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "warn’t" (archaic spelling, not incorrect but may be considered inconsistent with modern usage)  
- [GRAMMAR] "I begun to get a little anxious" (incorrect tense; should be "began")  
- [GRAMMAR] "I begun to see I’d woke up a pretty ugly customer" (tense inconsistency)  
- [GRAMMAR] "I gained and gained, little by little, till at last I went skimming sweetly by" (awkward phrasing and tense shift)  
- [SPELLING] "clothe her from stem to rudder-post" (archaic phrasing, not incorrect but inconsistent with modern usage)  
- [GRAMMAR] "I’ve seen comets out there that couldn’t even lay down inside the _orbits_ of our noblest comets without their tails hanging over." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "I had him _again_, Peters!" (punctuation inconsistency)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He turned to the side and hoist his glass" (tense inconsistency; "hoist" should be "hoisted")  
- [GRAMMAR] "I noticed the officer of the deck come to the side" (tense inconsistency; should be "came")  
- [SPELLING] "I was pointed straight for the Hereafter" (archaic phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The narrative assumes knowledge of heaven and the afterlife, which may be confusing to some readers  
- [STRUCTURE] The story jumps between the narrator's journey through space and his interaction at the gates of heaven without clear transition  
- [CLARITY] The concept of "kazarks" is introduced without explanation, making it difficult to grasp the scale of the cargo  
- [LOGIC] The shift from a race with a comet to arriving at heaven is abrupt and lacks a clear narrative connection  
- [CLARITY] The use of archaic and metaphorical language can make the meaning ambiguous in parts  
- [STRUCTURE] The repeated use of "Peters" as a conversational device interrupts the narrative flow  
- [LOGIC] The narrator's confusion at the gates of heaven is inconsistent with the earlier description of his journey through space
