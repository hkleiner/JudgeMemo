2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in tone from narrative to academic-style discussion of the bloodstain in Chapter II  
- [STRUCTURE] The passage discussing the breakfast and the bloodstain recurrence is repetitive and lacks a smooth transition from the previous events  
- [CLARITY] The description of the ghost's appearance is vivid, but the transition from Mr. Otis's encounter to the twins' pillow attack is abrupt  
- [TRANSITION] The narrative moves from the ghost’s appearance to the twins’ actions without a logical connection  
- [LOGIC] The ghost's reaction to the lubricator is inconsistent with his character as portrayed earlier
