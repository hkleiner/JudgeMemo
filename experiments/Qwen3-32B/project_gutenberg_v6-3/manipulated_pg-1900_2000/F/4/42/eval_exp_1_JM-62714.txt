2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The narrative shifts abruptly between Betsey’s imagination and real-world events without clear transitions.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks clear paragraph breaks and formatting, making it harder to follow the flow.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and contain multiple actions or ideas, making them confusing.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the dolls' imaginary conversations to Betsey's actions is sometimes jarring and not clearly connected.  
- [CONSISTENCY] The tone and pacing vary between sections, which disrupts the overall coherence of the story.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
