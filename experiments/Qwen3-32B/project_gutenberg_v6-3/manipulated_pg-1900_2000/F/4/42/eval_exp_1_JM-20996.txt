2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text jumps from the preface to a detailed account of the voyage and then to descriptions of Honolulu and Manila without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative sometimes shifts abruptly between descriptive passages and historical or anecdotal interjections without clear context.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative lacks a clear progression from one event to the next, making the overall structure feel disjointed.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of transitional phrases between paragraphs and chapters, making the flow between ideas and locations unclear.  
- [CLARITY] Some passages are overly verbose or contain redundant information, making the central narrative harder to follow.  
- [LOGIC] The inclusion of the "Century Magazine for September, 1889" reference is out of place and disrupts the narrative flow.  
- [CLARITY] The passage about the "Revels of Neptune" and the Napoleon anecdote is inserted without context and is disconnected from the main narrative.
