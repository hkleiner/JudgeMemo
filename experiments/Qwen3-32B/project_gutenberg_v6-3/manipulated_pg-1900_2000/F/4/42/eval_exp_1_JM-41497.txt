2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is generally well-structured, but the final paragraphs shift abruptly to discussing Reynolds' personal life and character flaws without a clear transition.  
- [LOGIC] Some statements are loosely connected, such as the mention of Dr. Johnson's comment on Reynolds' drinking, which is introduced without clear relevance to the broader narrative.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing Reynolds' artistic development to his social interactions and personal flaws is abrupt and lacks smooth transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The sentence "he could not have given the world any one of the pictures that are reproduced here" is unclear and confusing.  
- [LOGIC] The comparison between Reynolds and modern figures ("There is hardly a 'Lion Comique,' or a lady of the music halls drawing prime minister's salary [...]") is jarring and disrupts the historical narrative.
