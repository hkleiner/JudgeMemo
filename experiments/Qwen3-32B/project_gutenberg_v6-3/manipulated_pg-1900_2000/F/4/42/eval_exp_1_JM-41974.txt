Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "that has adhere to him ever since"  
- [GRAMMAR] "the decease of the great painter is entered as having occurred the 19th of April, 1588"  
- [GRAMMAR] "Veronese's father, was of a logical turn of mind"  
- [GRAMMAR] "History and tradition did not counted with him"  
- [GRAMMAR] "If he wish to paint a Last Supper"  
- [GRAMMAR] "whatever it would be, he could not conceive of, unless around a sumptuous table"  
- [SPELLING] "Musselman" (likely should be "Moslem" or "Muslim")  
- [SPELLING] "Tiene" (likely should be "Tiene" is a typo, possibly "Tiene" is correct as a proper noun, but unclear)  
- [SPELLING] "Fanzolo" (likely correct, but inconsistent capitalization in some parts of the text)  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "He ran the danger of acquiring mannerisms and becoming an imitator."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly between different aspects of Veronese's life without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] Some sentences are logically disjointed, such as "He was born at Verona in 1528 and not in 1530, as is asserted by several of his biographers..." followed by a detailed explanation that lacks a smooth connection.  
- [CLARITY] The sentence "It is at Venice that the Feast at the House of Simon the Pharisee, the Feast at the House of Levi take place" is confusing in its phrasing and lacks clarity.  
- [LOGIC] The text occasionally repeats ideas without adding new information, which disrupts the flow.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the introduction to the chapter "The First Years" is abrupt and lacks a clear connection to the prior content.  
- [LOGIC] The sentence "He ran the danger of acquiring mannerisms and becoming an imitator. By a special grace accorded to genius alone, Veronese succeeded in remaining himself..." lacks a clear logical progression.
