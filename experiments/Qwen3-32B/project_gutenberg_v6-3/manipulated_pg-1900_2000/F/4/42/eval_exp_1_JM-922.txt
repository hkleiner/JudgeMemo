Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "pleasurers" should be "pleasers"
- [GRAMMAR] "which has been prepare by the good man" should be "which has been prepared by the good man"
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing punctuation after "Sabbath" in "for some measure for securing the better observance of the Sabbath, which has been prepare by the good man"
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after "for instance" in "the seventh commandment for instance"
- [SPELLING] "poising" should be "poising" (though this might be a dialectical variant of "poising" or "poising")
- [GRAMMAR] "The glass is circulated, and the joke went round" has tense inconsistency

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different locations and perspectives without clear transitions
- [LOGIC] The contrast between the fashionable church and the less orthodox chapel is abrupt and not clearly connected to the overall theme
- [TRANSITION] The shift from describing Sunday activities in London to the religious services is not smoothly executed
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph about the chapel and preacher is overly dramatic and lacks clear connection to the rest of the text
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative lacks a clear progression or unifying thread, making it difficult to follow the author's main point

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
