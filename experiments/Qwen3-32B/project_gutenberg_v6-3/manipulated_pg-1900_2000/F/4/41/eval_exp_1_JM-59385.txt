- [STRUCTURE] The story lacks a clear progression from the pearl shop scene to the memory and back, making the narrative feel disjointed.  
- [CLARITY] Some phrases are ambiguous or overly complex, such as "the care with which they had been selected and to pay homage in memory to the experience and knowledge..."  
- [LOGIC] The connection between the memory of the mission school and the present scene is not clearly established.  
- [TRANSITION] The return to the present from the memory is abrupt and lacks smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The resolution of Kuei Ping's internal conflict is not clearly explained or resolved.
