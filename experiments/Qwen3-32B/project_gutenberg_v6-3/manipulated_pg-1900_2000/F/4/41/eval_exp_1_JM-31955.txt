2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text is a historical narrative about Niagara, but lacks clear paragraphing and sectioning, making it difficult to follow the logical flow of ideas
- [LOGIC] Some statements make abrupt shifts in focus without clear transitions, such as moving from legends to scientific explanations of rainbows
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and contain multiple ideas, making it difficult to discern the main point
- [TRANSITION] There are few transitional phrases to guide the reader through the different sections of the text
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different topics (legends, scientific explanations, historical accounts) without clear organization or connection
- [LOGIC] The relationship between the legends and the historical facts is not always clearly established
