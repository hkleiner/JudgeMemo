- [LOGIC] Some transitions between ideas are abrupt, especially when shifting between abstract concepts and concrete examples.  
- [CLARITY] The distinction between the two types of mind is occasionally blurred or repeated, reducing clarity.  
- [TRANSITION] Some paragraphs begin without clear connection to the previous one, causing a disjointed reading experience.  
- [LOGIC] The argument occasionally assumes a level of reader familiarity with philosophical or moral concepts without sufficient explanation.  
- [CLARITY] Some phrases are overly complex and obscure the intended meaning, such as "the existence of piebald horses proves that white is black."
