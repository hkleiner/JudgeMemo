2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text jumps between detailed descriptions of books and broader historical commentary without clear transitions.  
- [STRUCTURE] The sequence of books and their descriptions is occasionally confusing, making it hard to follow which printer or city is being discussed at any point.  
- [CLARITY] Some terms and references are ambiguous or unclear (e.g., "the first part of whjch" â€“ unclear antecedent).  
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between sections are abrupt or missing, especially when moving from one printer to another or from one book to the next.  
- [CLARITY] Some phrases are overly complex or convoluted, making the meaning difficult to grasp without re-reading.
