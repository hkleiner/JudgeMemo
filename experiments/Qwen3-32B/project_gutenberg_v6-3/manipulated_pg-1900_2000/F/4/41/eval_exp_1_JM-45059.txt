2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different topics without clear transitions (e.g., from the toll bars to the hospitals, then to breweries, then to transportation).  
- [LOGIC] Some anecdotes appear disconnected from the main narrative, such as the story about the calculating boy and the marbles.  
- [CLARITY] The text occasionally lacks clarity due to ambiguous phrasing or missing context (e.g., "You see it is an ill wind that blows nobody good").  
- [TRANSITION] Some paragraphs begin abruptly, making it difficult to follow the logical flow of ideas.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text mixes formal historical narration with informal anecdotes, which can confuse the reader about the intended tone and purpose.  
- [LOGIC] The connection between the toll bar system and the broader historical development of Peterborough is not clearly explained.
