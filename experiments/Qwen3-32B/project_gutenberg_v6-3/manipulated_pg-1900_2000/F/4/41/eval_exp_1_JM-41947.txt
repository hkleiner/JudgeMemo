2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between multiple events and time periods without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The connection between the historical events and Boucher's personal life is sometimes unclear.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and hard to follow (e.g., "The year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the Fourteenth being still King of France...").  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from one paragraph to the next is often abrupt, especially between historical context and character development.  
- [LOGIC] The significance of some events (e.g., the Italian tour) is not clearly explained in relation to Boucher's development as an artist.  
- [STRUCTURE] The chronology is occasionally confusing, with events described out of order or with unclear temporal references.
