- [STRUCTURE] The narrative lacks a clear progression and is composed of loosely connected vignettes without a central unifying theme or purpose  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, making it difficult to follow the intended meaning  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between different locations and perspectives (e.g., from the streets of London to the church and then to the chapel) without clear connections  
- [CONSISTENCY] The narrative shifts between a descriptive and observational tone to a more judgmental and critical tone without clear justification
