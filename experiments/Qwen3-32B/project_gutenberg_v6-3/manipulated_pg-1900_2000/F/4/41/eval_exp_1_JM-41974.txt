- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between paragraphs and ideas without clear connective phrases.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, making it difficult to follow the logical progression.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between descriptions of Veronese's works and his biographical details without clear organization.
