- [CLARITY] The author frequently uses complex and archaic language, which may obscure the meaning for many readers.  
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and ideas are abrupt or missing, making it difficult to track the progression of the argument.  
- [CONSISTENCY] Some terms and concepts are introduced and used inconsistently, leading to ambiguity.  
- [FOCUS] The text shifts between abstract generalizations and specific historical examples without clear indication of how they support the central thesis.
