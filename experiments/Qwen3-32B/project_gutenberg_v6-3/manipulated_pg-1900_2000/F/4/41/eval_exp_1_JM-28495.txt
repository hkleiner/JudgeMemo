2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative is generally coherent but has a few abrupt shifts in focus, such as the sudden transition to discussing the Crystal Palace incident.  
- [LOGIC] Some transitions are slightly disjointed, particularly when the couple shifts from following the man to their eventual frustration and return home.  
- [CLARITY] A few sentences are slightly confusing due to awkward phrasing or missing context, such as the part where the couple is following the man and then suddenly loses him.  
- [TRANSITION] Some transitions between paragraphs are abrupt, especially after the man disappears and the couple is left alone.
