2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is very long and dense, making it difficult to follow the narrative flow.  
- [LOGIC] Some transitions between ideas are abrupt or unclear, especially in the sections about the Yögur language and history.  
- [CLARITY] Some terms and names are ambiguous or not clearly defined, such as "Sarö Yögurs" and "Kuzurkei."  
- [TRANSITION] There are frequent shifts in focus without clear transitions, especially between descriptions of the landscape, the people, and the lamas.  
- [LOGIC] Some parts of the text seem disconnected from the main narrative, such as the detailed description of the kettles and the clothing.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about the legend of Shiche-Hache is not clearly separated from the surrounding text, making it hard to follow.  
- [LOGIC] The text occasionally jumps between different topics (e.g., from the temple to the village administration to the clothing) without clear signposting.
