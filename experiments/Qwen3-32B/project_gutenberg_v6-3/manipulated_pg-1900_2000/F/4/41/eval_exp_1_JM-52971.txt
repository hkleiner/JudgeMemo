2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly between topics without clear transitions (e.g., from the Apache to the Comanche without clear progression).  
- [LOGIC] Some statements are vague or lack sufficient context to be logically coherent (e.g., "he may have stayed where his descendants later became what we now call the ‘Basketmakers’").  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are ambiguous or unclear (e.g., "Tben, too, long periods of time must be taken into consideration").  
- [LOGIC] The text occasionally contradicts itself or lacks resolution (e.g., the statement that the Basketmakers "probably joined the Pueblo groups" is presented without supporting evidence).  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative is disjointed at times, with unclear connections between paragraphs.  
- [CLARITY] Some terms are introduced without explanation, making the text harder to follow for a general audience (e.g., "dolichocephalic").
