2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The narrative shifts abruptly between Betsey's imagination and the real-world perspective without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The doll characters act with human-like awareness and dialogue, but their actions are not clearly explained as part of Betsey’s imaginative play.  
- [LOGIC] The sudden introduction of characters like Tom and the carpenter Mr. Jones lacks contextual clarity.  
- [LOGIC] The text occasionally references past events (e.g., previous gifts like the bicycle and pony) without sufficient setup.  
- [LOGIC] The doll-house construction and furniture-making process is described in a way that blurs the line between Betsey’s imagination and reality.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps between Betsey's role as Mr. Betts and her real-world interactions with her parents.  
- [LOGIC] The telephone construction is described in detail but is not clearly connected to the overall narrative.  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the doll-house construction to the clock-making at the end is abrupt and lacks cohesion.
