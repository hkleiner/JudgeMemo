2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative shifts abruptly from descriptions of the valley and hotel to character details without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] Some plot points are introduced without sufficient setup or explanation (e.g., the sudden mention of Marie Clavert's father's death and Madame Bauche's adoption of her).  
- [CLARITY] The connection between the setting and the characters' motivations is not always clear, making the emotional stakes less immediate.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the description of the valley and hotel to the personal story of Madame Bauche and her son is abrupt and lacks smooth narrative flow.  
- [CONSISTENCY] Some character actions (e.g., Madame Bauche's strictness and her kindness to Marie) are presented without clear resolution or deeper exploration.
