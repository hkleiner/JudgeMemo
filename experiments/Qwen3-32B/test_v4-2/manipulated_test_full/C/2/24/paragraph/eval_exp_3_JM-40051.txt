2. **Non-repetitiveness**: The text suffers from significant repetition, with the author reiterating the same points and descriptions multiple times.
3. **Smooth Connections**: Transitions between sections and ideas are often abrupt, and the text lacks smooth connectors that would help the reader follow the author's reasoning.
4. **Ambiguity Avoidance**: The text is often ambiguous, with unclear references and vague descriptions that make it difficult to follow the author's arguments.
