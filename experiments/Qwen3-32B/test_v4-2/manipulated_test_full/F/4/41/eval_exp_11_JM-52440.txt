### Fluency Evaluation Issues:

1. **Syntax and Grammar**: There are several grammatical errors, including missing or incorrect articles, incorrect prepositions, and run-on sentences. For example, "and such result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the assertion, ans place reliance on those who make it" (incorrect use of "ans").

2. **Spelling and Punctuation**: There are numerous spelling errors throughout the text, such as "vlindly," "experiejced," "het," "Docteine," "iur," "yhat," "cse," "tuey," "thr," "cso," "Gox," "ftom," "it pleqse Gox," "buc," "non," "bug," "tne," "firstvsight," "eaber," "ad," "wity," "Xhrist," "nChrist," "yhe," "Communkon," "belirve," "heartt," "Xhrist," "nChrist," "yhe," "nChrist," "nChrist," "vthe," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist," "nChrist,"
