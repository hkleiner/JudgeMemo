2. **Spelling and Punctuation**: There are many spelling errors (e.g., "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians", "dimentions" instead of "dimensions") and punctuation errors (e.g., missing commas, incorrect use of dashes). These errors interfere with the flow and comprehension.

3. **Smooth Connections**: The transitions between sections and ideas are often abrupt or missing, making the text feel disjointed.
4. **Ambiguity Avoidance**: The text contains several ambiguous or unclear statements that make it difficult to understand the author's intended meaning.
