### Fluency Evaluation Aspects:

1. **Syntax and Grammar**:  
   - Multiple grammatical errors, including incorrect verb tenses and subject-verb agreement.  
   - Misuse of prepositions and incorrect word forms (e.g., "was taught" instead of "is taught").  
   - Run-on sentences and awkward sentence structures.

2. **Spelling and Punctuation**:  
   - Several spelling errors (e.g., "bless" instead of "blessed", "wased" instead of "was", "consisted" instead of "consists").  
   - Missing or incorrect punctuation (e.g., missing commas, incorrect use of quotation marks).  
   - Inconsistent capitalization (e.g., "church of England" vs. "Church of England").

3. **Word Choice**:  
   - Some vocabulary is archaic or overly formal, which may affect readability for modern readers.  
   - Some word choices are unclear or ambiguous (e.g., "was not now making any assertion" – unclear phrasing).  
   - Redundant or unnecessarily complex phrasing (e.g., "It is my own belief that they do not").

4. **Phrasing**:  
   - Phrases are often awkward or worded in a confusing manner.  
   - Some sentences are overly long and lack clarity.  
   - Repetition of ideas without adding new meaning.

5. **Flow**:  
   - The flow between sentences and paragraphs is occasionally disrupted by grammatical errors and awkward phrasing.  
   - Transitions between ideas are not always smooth.  
   - The overall structure is somewhat logical, but the language hinders smooth reading.

### Coherence Evaluation Aspects:

1. **Logical Sequencing**:  
   - The overall structure of the text is logical and follows a clear progression from introduction to argument to conclusion.  
   - The introduction sets up the purpose and context for the discussion.  
   - Each section builds on the previous one.

2. **Non-repetitiveness**:  
   - Some ideas are repeated unnecessarily (e.g., restating the importance of examining the Church’s documents).  
   - Some points are made in slightly different ways, which could be condensed for clarity.

3. **Smooth Connections**:  
   - The transitions between paragraphs and ideas are generally smooth, but some could be improved with clearer linking phrases.  
   - The use of "Now," "Thus far," and "In opposition to this" helps maintain coherence.  
   - Some shifts in focus are abrupt and could be clarified.

4. **Ambiguity Avoidance**:  
   - The text is generally clear in its argument, though some phrasing introduces ambiguity (e.g., "the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of our blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine").  
   - Some sentences are unclear due to grammatical errors or awkward phrasing.

5. **Structural Consistency**:  
   - The structure is consistent in that it follows a clear argument with an introduction, thesis, and supporting points.  
   - The use of headings and subheadings is consistent and aids in navigation.  
   - The text maintains a formal and theological tone throughout.
