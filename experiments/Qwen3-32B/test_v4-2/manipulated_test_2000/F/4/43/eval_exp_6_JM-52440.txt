### Coherence Evaluation:

**1. Logical Sequencing**:  
- The overall structure is logical, with the text progressing from introduction to specific doctrines.  
- However, the flow within paragraphs is sometimes disjointed, with ideas introduced and then lost or repeated without clear progression.

**2. Non-repetitiveness**:  
- There is a notable amount of repetition, especially in the discussion of sacraments and doctrine.  
- Some points are restated without adding new information, which weakens the argumentative force.

**3. Smooth Connections**:  
- Transitions between paragraphs are often abrupt or missing.  
- The use of connective phrases is inconsistent, leading to a lack of smooth progression between ideas.

**4. Ambiguity Avoidance**:  
- The text is often ambiguous or unclear in its phrasing.  
- Some sentences are so convoluted that the intended meaning is difficult to discern.  
- The use of theological jargon without explanation may confuse readers unfamiliar with the subject.

**5. Structural Consistency**:  
- The text follows a clear structure in its introduction and chapter headings.  
- However, the internal structure of paragraphs is inconsistent, with some meandering and others abruptly ending.
