- The lack of clear punctuation and sentence completion hinders smooth transitions.  

**Ambiguity Avoidance**:  
- The text is often ambiguous due to missing words and incorrect phrasing.  
- Some sentences are so incomplete or grammatically incorrect that they are difficult to interpret.  

**Structural Consistency**:  
- The overall structure is consistent with the format of a critical essay, but the internal structure of many sentences and paragraphs is inconsistent due to grammatical errors.
