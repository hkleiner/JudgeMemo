### **Fluency Evaluation**  
The text is generally fluent and grammatically correct, but there are a few issues that slightly disrupt the smooth reading experience:

- **Syntax and Grammar**: Mostly well-constructed, but some sentences are overly long and complex, making them harder to follow.
- **Spelling and Punctuation**: No major spelling or punctuation errors were found.
- **Word Choice**: Vocabulary is appropriate and formal, fitting the context of a theological or historical narrative.
- **Phrasing**: Some phrasing is awkward or verbose, particularly in the theological sections, where clarity is occasionally sacrificed for formality.
- **Flow**: The narrative transitions are mostly smooth, but the shift from theological discourse to the ghost story and then to George Stransom’s internal monologue is abrupt and jarring.

### **Coherence Evaluation**  
The text contains multiple distinct sections with differing tones and styles, which creates coherence issues:

- **Logical Sequencing**: The story jumps between unrelated sections (e.g., theological discourse, ghost story, character reflection), making the overall narrative disjointed.
- **Non-repetitiveness**: While the content is not repetitive, the abrupt shifts in topic and tone reduce the sense of a unified narrative.
- **Smooth Connections**: The transitions between the different narrative sections are abrupt and lack logical or thematic continuity.
- **Ambiguity Avoidance**: Some parts are ambiguous due to the lack of clear context or connection between sections.
- **Structural Consistency**: The structure is inconsistent. The text begins with a conversation, shifts to a theological essay, then to a ghost story, and ends with a character’s internal reflection, with no clear unifying thread.
