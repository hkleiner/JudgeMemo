### Fluency Evaluation Issues:

1. **Syntax and Grammar**:  
   - Some sentences are overly complex and convoluted, making them difficult to follow.  
   - A few instances of passive voice and awkward phrasing reduce clarity.  
   - Minor grammatical errors are present, such as missing articles or incorrect prepositions.  

2. **Spelling and Punctuation**:  
   - Generally correct, but some punctuation is inconsistent or missing in complex sentences.  
   - Hyphenation and capitalization of terms like “stuff” and “thing” appear inconsistent and confusing.  

3. **Word Choice**:  
   - Some word choices are archaic or unclear (e.g., “the stuff,” “a thing”).  
   - The use of repetitive terms like “sacrament” and “presence” can become monotonous.  
   - Some vocabulary is unnecessarily formal or obscure, potentially hindering readability.  

4. **Phrasing**:  
   - Several phrases are awkward or redundant (e.g., “It is not my business now to discuss the connexion…”).  
   - The use of phrases like “a thing, and the thing” is unclear and disrupts the flow.  
   - Some sentences are overly long and could be split for better clarity.  

5. **Flow**:  
   - The text generally flows well within paragraphs, but transitions between ideas are sometimes abrupt.  
   - Some paragraphs begin without clear connection to the previous one, leading to a disjointed reading experience.

### Coherence Evaluation Issues:

1. **Logical Sequencing**:  
   - The overall structure is logical and follows a clear argumentative path.  
   - However, the introduction of new concepts (e.g., the "stuff") without clear definition disrupts the logical flow.  
   - The repetition of key ideas across paragraphs can confuse the reader.  

2. **Non-repetitiveness**:  
   - There is a noticeable amount of repetition, especially in the discussion of the sacraments and the real presence.  
   - Some ideas are restated multiple times without adding new insights.  

3. **Smooth Connections**:  
   - Transitions between paragraphs are generally smooth, but some shifts in topic are abrupt.  
   - The use of terms like “a thing” and “the thing” without clear antecedents makes the connections between ideas unclear.  

4. **Ambiguity Avoidance**:  
   - Several phrases are ambiguous or unclear (e.g., “the stuff,” “a thing”).  
   - The lack of clear definitions for key terms makes the text confusing at times.  
   - Some theological distinctions are not clearly explained, making it difficult to follow the argument.  

5. **Structural Consistency**:  
   - The text maintains a consistent structure in its argumentation.  
   - However, the inconsistent use of terminology and the repetition of ideas reduce structural clarity.  
   - The introduction of new concepts without prior explanation can disrupt the consistency of the narrative.
