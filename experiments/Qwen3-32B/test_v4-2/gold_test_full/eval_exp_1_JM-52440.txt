### Fluency Evaluation:

1. **Syntax and Grammar**: The text is generally well-structured with correct grammar. However, there are occasional long and complex sentences that may be difficult to follow.
2. **Spelling and Punctuation**: There are no noticeable spelling or punctuation errors that disrupt the flow of the text.
3. **Word Choice**: The vocabulary is appropriate for the formal theological context. The language is precise and suitable for the subject matter.
4. **Phrasing**: The phrasing is mostly clear, though some sentences are quite long and could be more concise for better readability.
5. **Flow**: The text flows well for the most part, with logical transitions between paragraphs. However, some sections are dense and could benefit from more paragraph breaks or clearer signposting.

### Coherence Evaluation:

1. **Logical Sequencing**: The text follows a logical structure, with an introduction, followed by chapters on the Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice. Each section builds on the previous one.
2. **Non-repetitiveness**: The text is largely free from unnecessary repetition. The arguments are developed progressively and do not restate the same points.
3. **Smooth Connections**: The transitions between sections are generally smooth, though some paragraphs could be better connected to enhance the flow.
4. **Ambiguity Avoidance**: The text avoids ambiguity in most cases, with clear explanations of theological concepts. However, the dense nature of some sections may lead to confusion for readers unfamiliar with the subject.
5. **Structural Consistency**: The structure is consistent and well-organized, with clear headings and a logical progression of ideas.
