Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative abruptly shifts between biographical details and broader historical commentary without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about the "home assistant played ambient music" and "the energy grid remained balanced" are disjointed and lack logical connection to the rest of the text.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about "a livestream began recording" is similarly out of context and disrupts the narrative flow.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are vague or ambiguous, such as “The two jobbers are kicked,” which lacks clarity and explanation.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the introduction to the chapter "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" is abrupt and lacks a smooth narrative bridge.  
- [COHERENCE] The timeline of events in the second chapter is occasionally unclear or disjointed, making it difficult to follow the progression of Will Bradley’s early life.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
