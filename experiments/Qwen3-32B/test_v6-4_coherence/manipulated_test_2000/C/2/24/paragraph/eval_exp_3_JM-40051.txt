Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and logical structure, with ideas presented in a disjointed and repetitive manner.  
- [LOGIC] The argument for identifying a specific location as the Garden of Eden is weak and relies on tenuous or speculative connections to biblical descriptions.  
- [CLARITY] The writing is often vague and unclear, with ambiguous references that make it difficult to follow the authorâ€™s reasoning.  
- [TRANSITION] There are abrupt transitions between ideas, with little or no connecting phrases or logical flow.  
- [COHERENCE] The text contains numerous digressions and unsupported claims, making the overall narrative incoherent and difficult to follow.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
