Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden and irrelevant insertions (e.g., "The voice recognition module powered up," "The autonomous vehicle waited at the curb," "The biosensor updated its readout") disrupt the logical flow and thematic focus of the text.  
- [LOGIC] The argument is internally coherent in its theological and doctrinal discussion, but the presence of intrusive, unrelated sentences breaks the reader’s immersion and undermines the text’s overall coherence.  
- [CLARITY] The theological argument is clear and logically structured, but the presence of jarring, out-of-place sentences introduces confusion and reduces the clarity of the overall narrative.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
