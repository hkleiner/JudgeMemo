Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The reappearance of the blood stain is not clearly explained, creating a logical inconsistency.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of unrelated modern elements like a hologram, bluetooth signal, and surveillance camera disrupts the narrative's historical and supernatural tone.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the family's arrival at Canterville Chase to the ghost's first appearance feels abrupt and disconnected.  
- [LOGIC] The ghost's sudden and unexplained reaction to the pillow-throwing twins lacks a logical or emotional build-up.  
- [COHESION] The dialogue between Mr. Otis and the ghost is humorous and anachronistic, but it does not contribute to the overall narrative cohesion or character development.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
