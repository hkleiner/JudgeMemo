Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and logical progression between paragraphs and sections, especially in the transition from the introduction to the story summary.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and ambiguous, such as the line “Of course no Dean would entrust keys to this incredibly dissipated,” which abruptly cuts off and leaves the reader confused.  
- [TRANSITION] There are abrupt shifts between topics and characters without sufficient context or connection, such as the sudden introduction of Sapsea and Durdles with little prior setup.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative occasionally presents information in a disjointed manner, making it difficult to follow the relationships between characters and the plot development.  
- [STRUCTURE] The ending of the excerpt is incomplete or cut off mid-sentence, which disrupts the overall flow and coherence of the text.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
