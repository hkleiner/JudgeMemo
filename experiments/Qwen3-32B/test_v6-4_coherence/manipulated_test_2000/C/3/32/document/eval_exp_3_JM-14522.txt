Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] The text contains inconsistent references to characters and places (e.g., "Lord a thing," "a stuff") that disrupt logical flow and clarity. - [CLARITY] Some sentences are confusing due to vague or undefined references, making it difficult to follow the narrative. - [STRUCTURE] The transition from the introduction of the Otis family to the supernatural events feels abrupt and lacks smooth progression. - [COHESION] The reappearance of the bloodstain and the ghost's introduction are not clearly connected to the earlier setup, causing disjointedness. - [TRANSITION] The shift from the family's arrival and casual conversation to the ghost's dramatic appearance lacks a smooth narrative bridge.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
