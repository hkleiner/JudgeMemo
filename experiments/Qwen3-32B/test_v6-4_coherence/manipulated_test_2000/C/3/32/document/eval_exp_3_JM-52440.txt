Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent use of terms such as "the stuff" and "a thing" without clear definitions, leading to confusion.  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetition of ideas without clear progression, particularly in the introductory chapter.  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous phrasing in critical arguments, such as "the real point at issue" being left undefined for too long.  
- [TRANSITION] Poor transitions between sections and paragraphs, making the flow between ideas disjointed.  
- [LOGIC] Contradictory implications in the argumentation, such as claiming the Church of England's doctrine is consistent with the general definition of sacraments, yet later implying inconsistency without resolution.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
