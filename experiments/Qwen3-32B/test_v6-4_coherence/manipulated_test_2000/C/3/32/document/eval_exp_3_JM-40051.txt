Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Text lacks a clear, logical structure; ideas are presented in a disjointed and repetitive manner.  
- [LOGIC] Claims are made without sufficient supporting evidence or logical progression.  
- [CLARITY] Excessive use of vague and undefined terms (e.g., “the thing,” “a stuff”) hinders understanding.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between topics and unclear transitions between paragraphs disrupt the flow.  
- [COHERENCE] The narrative lacks a unified theme and is filled with speculative assertions without clear connections to the central idea.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
