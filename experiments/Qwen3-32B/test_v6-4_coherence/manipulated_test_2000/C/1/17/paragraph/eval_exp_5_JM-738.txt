Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from a detailed narrative about Stransom and Mary Antrim to an unrelated discussion about Dickens and Edwin Drood without clear connection.  
- [LOGIC] Unclear relationship between the shop-front scene and the broader analysis of Dickens's novels, creating confusion about the text's purpose.  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous pronoun usage ("he," "him," "she") in the shop-front scene without clear antecedents, making it difficult to follow the narrative.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the personal anecdote involving Stransom and Creston to a biographical and critical discussion of Dickens, lacking smooth narrative flow.  
- [COHERENCE] The text begins with a literary analysis but then shifts into a narrative vignette and then returns to literary criticism without a unifying thread.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
