Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between unrelated narrative segments and a formal theological discourse.  
- [LOGIC] Confusing juxtaposition of a ghost story excerpt with a theological treatise without any logical connection.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of transitional elements between the initial dialogue, the theological discussion, and the unrelated narrative about blood stains and characters like Washington and Mr. Otis.  
- [CLARITY] Inconsistent tone and subject matter make it difficult to follow the intended focus or purpose of the text.  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed organization with multiple narrative and thematic threads introduced without resolution or connection.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
