Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text abruptly shifts from an introduction about Will Bradley to a detailed narrative involving characters like Stransom, Creston, and Mary Antrim, with no clear connection to Bradley or the main topic.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative about Stransom and the jeweller’s shop is disjointed and seems unrelated to the introduction about Will Bradley, creating confusion about the text’s focus.  
- [TRANSITION] There is a jarring transition from the introduction to the story of a boy printer in Ishpeming without any logical or thematic bridge.  
- [CLARITY] The narrative about Sir Simon and the Chase is inserted without context or explanation, disrupting the flow and confusing the reader.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text appears to be a patchwork of different sections (introduction, narrative, biography) without a clear overarching structure or purpose.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
