Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly between abstract theological concepts and specific doctrinal definitions without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The argument is occasionally unclear, with sentences that are convoluted or lack a clear logical progression.  
- [CLARITY] Some phrases are redundant or poorly constructed, making the meaning difficult to follow (e.g., “That the the of two perfectly the eating faith, kinds by and, the distinct other feeding; actions food soul the the, and bread of other body; Himself there one for the; other of one Christ material are for on, body the perfectly the the soul one two distinct the spiritual.”).  
- [TRANSITION] There is a lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs, especially between the introduction and the first chapter, and between doctrinal points.  
- [COHERENCE] The text attempts to compare multiple theological views (e.g., Roman Catholic, Anglican, Reformation) but does not consistently clarify the distinctions or their relevance to the central argument.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
