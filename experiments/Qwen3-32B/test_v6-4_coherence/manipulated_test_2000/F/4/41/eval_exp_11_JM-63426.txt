Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative shifts abruptly between a general introduction about Will Bradley and a detailed biographical account of his childhood without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The timeline in the second chapter is fragmented and lacks a clear progression, making it difficult to follow the chronological development of Bradleyâ€™s early life.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, reducing readability and disrupting the flow of ideas.  
- [TRANSITION] The lack of transitional phrases or sentences between the first and second chapters makes the shift jarring and disorienting for the reader.  
- [COHERENCE] The text jumps between different locations and events without sufficient contextual clues, causing confusion about the setting and timeline.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
