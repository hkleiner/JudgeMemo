Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition between Chapter I and Chapter II is abrupt, with little to no setup or resolution from the first chapter to prepare the reader for the events in the second.  
- [LOGIC] The sudden reappearance of the blood stain is introduced without sufficient context or explanation, making the cause and effect unclear.  
- [CLARITY] Several typographical errors and misspellings (e.g., "seej by," "btye rector," "afger," "xven") disrupt the reader's ability to follow the narrative smoothly.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the family's arrival and introduction to the ghostâ€™s first appearance is disjointed, lacking a logical or narrative bridge.  
- [LOGIC] The ghost's reaction to the Minister's action is overly dramatic and unexplained, which creates confusion about the ghost's motivations and nature.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
