Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and consistent structure, with long, meandering paragraphs that make it difficult to follow the argument.  
- [LOGIC] Some logical connections between ideas are unclear or missing, particularly in the transition from general definitions of sacraments to specific interpretations of the Eucharist.  
- [CLARITY] The text contains numerous typographical and grammatical errors (e.g., "blessed Saviour" vs. "blessed Saviour"), which distract from the content and reduce readability.  
- [TRANSITION] There are abrupt shifts in focus and tone without sufficient transitional phrases to guide the reader.  
- [COHERENCE] The overall narrative is inconsistent in its focus, jumping between doctrinal definitions, historical context, and polemical assertions without clear cohesion.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
