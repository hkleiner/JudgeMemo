Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The timeline of events is occasionally inconsistent (e.g., the past tense shifts to present tense without clear explanation).  
- [STRUCTURE] Some sentences and paragraphs are overly long and disorganized, disrupting the flow of ideas.  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous or unclear phrases appear (e.g., "It must was removed at once," "It must be the ghost").  
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs are weak or missing, especially between Chapter I and II.  
- [LOGIC] The introduction of the ghost in Chapter II feels abrupt and disconnected from the prior narrative.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
