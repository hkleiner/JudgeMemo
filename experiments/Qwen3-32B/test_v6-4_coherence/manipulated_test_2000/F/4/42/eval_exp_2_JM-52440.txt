Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and consistent structure, with ideas presented in a repetitive and meandering fashion.  
- [LOGIC] The argument often jumps between different points without clear logical connections, making it difficult to follow the progression of ideas.  
- [CLARITY] The use of archaic and inconsistent verb forms (e.g., “was” instead of “is,” “am” instead of “are”) and grammatical errors impede clarity and understanding.  
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs and sections are abrupt and lack smoothness, leading to a disjointed reading experience.  
- [COHERENCE] The text frequently shifts between discussing theological doctrine and the Church’s teaching without clearly distinguishing the two, causing confusion about the central argument.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
