Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] The text abruptly shifts between narrative sections and technical/automated descriptions (e.g., "A drone docked without issue" in the middle of a dramatic scene). - [LOGIC] Inconsistent logic with ghostly phenomena and modern technology (e.g., the ghost being affected by AI systems and wireless chargers). - [CLARITY] Confusing blending of original plot with anachronistic elements (e.g., the ghost interacting with a "deepfake filter" or a "self-driving cart"). - [TRANSITION] Poor transitions between chapters and dramatic moments, especially when inserting unrelated technical phrases. - [COHERENCE] Overall narrative coherence is disrupted by random technological references that don't align with the 19th-century setting. - [STRUCTURE] The text maintains the original plot structure but is fragmented by intrusive modern elements.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
