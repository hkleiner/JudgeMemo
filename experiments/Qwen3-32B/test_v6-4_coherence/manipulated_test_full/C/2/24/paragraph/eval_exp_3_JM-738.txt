Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between multiple plot summaries and theories without clear transitions or organization, making it difficult to follow the main narrative.
   - [LOGIC] The connections between characters and events are not clearly explained, leading to confusion about relationships and motivations.
   - [CLARITY] The text frequently introduces new theories or interpretations without clearly distinguishing them from the main plot, creating ambiguity.
   - [TRANSITION] There are abrupt shifts between different sections of the story and between the narrative and analysis, lacking smooth transitions.
   - [COHERENCE] The text lacks a clear, unified structure, with disjointed sections that do not consistently build upon each other.
2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
