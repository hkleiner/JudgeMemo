Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is divided into chapters, but the flow between sections is inconsistent, with some sections feeling abruptly disconnected from others.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex or verbose, making it difficult to follow the main argument.  
- [LOGIC] The argument occasionally jumps between ideas without sufficient transitional phrases, making it challenging to follow the logical progression.  
- [TRANSITION] There are abrupt shifts in tone and content, such as the sudden appearance of unrelated phrases like “A keyboard clicked without being touched” and “A camera lens refocused itself,” which disrupt the narrative flow.  
- [COHERENCE] The inclusion of irrelevant or out-of-place sentences (e.g., “A smart bulb changed color” or “The iPhone was fully charged now”) breaks the coherence of the text and distracts from the central topic.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
