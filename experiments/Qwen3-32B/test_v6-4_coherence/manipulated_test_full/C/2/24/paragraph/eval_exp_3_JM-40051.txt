Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and logical organization; ideas are presented in a disjointed manner, making it difficult to follow the narrative.  
- [LOGIC] There are inconsistencies in the argumentation; the author shifts between presenting evidence, personal opinions, and speculative claims without clear transitions or justification.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between topics and paragraphs hinder the flow of the text. The reader is frequently moved from one descriptive detail to another without clear connections.  
- [CLARITY] The text is overly verbose and filled with tangential descriptions, making it challenging to identify the main point or argument.  
- [COHERENCE] The text contains repetitive statements and redundant descriptions that do not contribute to a unified narrative.  
- [LOGIC] The author makes speculative and unsupported claims (e.g., the location of the Garden of Eden) without sufficient evidence or logical progression.  
- [COHERENCE] The conclusion is abrupt and lacks resolution, leaving the reader with unresolved questions and a lack of closure.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
