Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] The text is a long, multi-chapter biography with a disjointed structure due to the lack of clear transitions between chapters and abrupt shifts in time and narrative focus.  
   - [LOGIC] Some sections lack logical progression, particularly in the transition from early life events to professional achievements without sufficient contextual linking.  
   - [CLARITY] The use of second-person narration ("you are six years old," "you are now on your way to Chicago") creates confusion about the narrative voice and perspective, especially when switching to third-person in other sections.  
   - [TRANSITION] There are no clear transitions between chapters or major events, making the narrative feel fragmented and lacking in cohesion.  
   - [REPETITION] Certain themes and events are repeated across different chapters, such as the emphasis on typography and design, which could have been consolidated for better flow.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
