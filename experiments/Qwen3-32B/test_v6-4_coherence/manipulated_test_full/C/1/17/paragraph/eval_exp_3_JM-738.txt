Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] The text has a complex narrative structure that is difficult to follow without prior knowledge of the context or the mystery being discussed.
 - [LOGIC] There are logical gaps in the reasoning presented, particularly in the analysis of the plot and theories about the mystery.
 - [TRANSITION] The transitions between different sections and theories are abrupt and lack smooth flow.
 - [CLARITY] The text is overly dense with details and theories, making it challenging to discern the main argument or narrative thread.
 - [COHERENCE] The overall coherence of the text is compromised by the inclusion of multiple theories and interpretations without clear organization or synthesis.
2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
