Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetitive descriptions of the same location and features without clear progression.  
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent claims about the Garden of Eden’s location and its biblical alignment, lacking a clear argumentative thread.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between topics (e.g., geological claims, historical figures, and speculative theories) without smooth transitions.  
- [CLARITY] Unclear or ambiguous references (e.g., "the stuff," "a thing") that disrupt understanding.  
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear organization or logical flow between paragraphs and ideas.  
- [LOGIC] Contradictory statements about the Garden’s characteristics (e.g., being both "inhabitable" and "not inhabited").  
- [CLARITY] Overuse of vague or metaphorical language without grounding in concrete details or evidence.  
- [LOGIC] Repeated assertions without supporting evidence or logical development.  
- [TRANSITION] Repeated sections (e.g., descriptions of the hanging garden and surrounding valleys) that create redundancy and confusion.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
