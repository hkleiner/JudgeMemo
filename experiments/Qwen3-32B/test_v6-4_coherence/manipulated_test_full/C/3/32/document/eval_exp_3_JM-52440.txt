Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text is overly long and lacks clear paragraphing, making it difficult to follow the flow of ideas.
- [CLARITY] The use of inconsistent and ambiguous terms (e.g., "the thing," "a stuff," "the stuff") hinders clarity and creates confusion about the subject being discussed.
- [LOGIC] The argument is repetitive and lacks a clear progression; the same points are made multiple times without advancing the discussion.
- [TRANSITION] There are abrupt shifts between ideas and sections without sufficient transitional phrases or explanations to guide the reader.
- [CLARITY] The text contains numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that disrupt the flow and make comprehension challenging.
- [STRUCTURE] The structure of the text is not well-organized; the introduction and conclusion are not clearly defined, and the logical sequence of arguments is unclear.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
