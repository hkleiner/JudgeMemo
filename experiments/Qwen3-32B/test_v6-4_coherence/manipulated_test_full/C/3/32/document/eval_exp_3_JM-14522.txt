Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different narrative styles and tones without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the overall structure.
- [LOGIC] There are logical inconsistencies in the narrative, such as the sudden reappearance of the blood-stain after it was supposedly removed.
- [CLARITY] The text contains numerous unclear references (e.g., "the stuff") that disrupt understanding.
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between chapters and scenes are abrupt and lack smooth progression.
- [COHESION] The story lacks a clear and consistent narrative thread, especially in the later chapters where the focus shifts without clear motivation.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
