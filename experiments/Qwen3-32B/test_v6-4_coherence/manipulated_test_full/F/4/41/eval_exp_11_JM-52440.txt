Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and consistent structure, with abrupt shifts between topics and sections without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] There are logical inconsistencies in the argumentation, particularly in the way claims are made without sufficient evidence or clear reasoning.  
- [CLARITY] Some sections are overly verbose and repetitive, which hinders clarity and makes the main points harder to follow.  
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs and sections are weak or absent, making the flow of the text feel disjointed.  
- [COHERENCE] The overall narrative lacks a unified progression, with some parts feeling isolated or unrelated to the main argument.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
