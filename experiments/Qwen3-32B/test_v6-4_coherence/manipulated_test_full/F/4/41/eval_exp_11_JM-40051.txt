- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between unrelated ideas and topics, such as geological features, historical claims, and religious interpretations.  
- [CLARITY] Overuse of vague or undefined terms and phrases, making it difficult to follow the authorâ€™s argument or reasoning.  
- [LOGIC] Lack of clear causal or logical connections between the Bible's description of Eden and the author's interpretation of the landscape.  
- [STRUCTURE] Frequent digressions and tangents that do not support the main claim, such as the author's personal anecdotes and unrelated historical references.
