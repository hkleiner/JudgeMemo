Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The story is divided into chapters, but the transitions between chapters are abrupt and lack smooth progression.
- [LOGIC] The behavior of the ghost is inconsistent at times, making it difficult to follow his motivations and reactions.
- [CLARITY] Some parts of the text are confusing, particularly the ghost's interactions with the Otis family and his eventual redemption.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the ghost's comedic attempts to frighten the family to his emotional and philosophical conversation with Virginia is abrupt and lacks sufficient setup.
- [CLARITY] The prophecy on the library window and its connection to Virginia's actions are introduced suddenly and without enough explanation for a clear understanding.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5
