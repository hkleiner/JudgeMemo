Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text is overly complex with dense, convoluted sentences that hinder clarity and logical progression.
- [LOGIC] The narrative frequently jumps between plot points and theories without sufficient explanation or transitions.
- [CLARITY] Some terms and names are inconsistently spelled or formatted (e.g., "Datchery" vs. "Datchery," "Cloisterham" vs. "Cloizterham").
- [TRANSITION] There are abrupt shifts between different sections and theories, making it difficult to follow the intended flow.
- [COHERENCE] The text lacks a unified structure, with multiple theories presented in a disjointed manner without clear delineation.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
