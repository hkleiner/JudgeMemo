Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative structure is generally coherent but contains some abrupt shifts between scenes and characters, particularly in the transition between chapters.
- [LOGIC] Some plot developments lack clear logical connections, such as the sudden disappearance of Virginia and the resolution of her encounter with the ghost, which is left somewhat ambiguous.
- [CLARITY] Certain passages are marred by grammatical errors and incoherent sentence structures, such as the line "It has been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always makes its appearance before the death of any member of our family," which is confusingly phrased.
- [TRANSITION] Some transitions between paragraphs are weak or missing, causing a disjointed reading experience, particularly in the shift from the ghost's perspective to the Otis family's reactions.
- [COHERENCE] A few instances of repetitive or redundant descriptions disrupt the flow, such as the repeated emphasis on the American family's skepticism toward the ghost.
- [COHERENCE] The ending of the story, particularly Virginia's secret and the resolution of the ghost's fate, feels slightly rushed and lacks sufficient emotional or narrative buildup to be fully satisfying.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
