Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is extremely long and dense, with multiple chapters and sections that are not clearly separated or introduced, making it difficult to follow the overall structure.  
- [LOGIC] The logical flow between paragraphs is occasionally disrupted by long, meandering sentences and complex theological arguments that are not clearly connected.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly convoluted and contain ambiguous phrasing, making it challenging to grasp the intended meaning without rereading.  
- [TRANSITION] There are abrupt transitions between ideas and sections, with insufficient signposting to guide the reader through the argument.  
- [RELEVANCE] Some sections include tangential or repetitive arguments that do not clearly contribute to the central thesis, reducing the textâ€™s overall coherence.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
