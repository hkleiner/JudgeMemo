Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and logical structure, jumping between descriptive passages, historical claims, and speculative assertions without clear transitions or organization.
- [LOGIC] The argument for identifying a specific location as the Garden of Eden is based on weak and speculative reasoning, with no clear logical progression or evidence-based argumentation.
- [CLARITY] The text contains numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and unclear sentences that make it difficult to follow the author's points.
- [TRANSITION] There are abrupt transitions between ideas and sections, with no smooth flow from one concept to the next.
- [COHERENCE] The text frequently contradicts itself and contains inconsistent claims about the Garden of Eden's location and characteristics.
- [CLARITY] The author uses overly complex and often nonsensical language that obscures meaning rather than clarifying it.
- [STRUCTURE] The text appears to be a series of disjointed observations and assertions rather than a cohesive narrative or argument.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.0
