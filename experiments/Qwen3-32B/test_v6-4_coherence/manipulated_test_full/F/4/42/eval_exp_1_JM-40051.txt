Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear, logical structure; it jumps between descriptions of the landscape, theological arguments, and historical references without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The argument for identifying the Garden of Eden in the Mississippi River valley is based on speculative and circular reasoning, with little logical progression or supporting evidence.  
- [CLARITY] The writing is often convoluted, with long, run-on sentences and unclear references, making it difficult to follow the author's main points.  
- [TRANSITION] There are no smooth transitions between sections, leading to abrupt shifts in focus and topic.  
- [COHERENCE] The narrative lacks a consistent thread, and the author frequently reiterates points without building on them or resolving contradictions.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
