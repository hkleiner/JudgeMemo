Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative lacks a clear progression in some sections, particularly in the early chapters where the introduction of characters and setting is somewhat meandering.
- [LOGIC] The transition from the introduction of the ghost's history to the Otis family's arrival is abrupt and lacks smooth connection.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly verbose and convoluted, making it difficult to follow the narrative flow, especially in the middle chapters.
- [TRANSITION] There are abrupt shifts in scene and time without sufficient transitional cues, such as the sudden jump from the ghost's interactions with the Otis family to his internal monologues.
- [LOGIC] The resolution of the ghost's fate feels somewhat rushed and underdeveloped, with the emotional and thematic implications not fully realized.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
