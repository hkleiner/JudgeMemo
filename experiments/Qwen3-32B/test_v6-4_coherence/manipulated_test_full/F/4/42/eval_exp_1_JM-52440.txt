Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is overly long and dense, making it difficult to follow the logical progression of ideas without losing the thread.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are excessively complex and convoluted, reducing clarity and readability.  
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs and sections are occasionally abrupt or missing, causing disjointedness in the flow of ideas.  
- [LOGIC] The argument occasionally shifts focus without clear indication, leading to minor logical inconsistencies or confusion in the reader's mind.  
- [REPETITION] Certain points are repeated unnecessarily, which weakens the overall coherence and could be condensed for better flow.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
