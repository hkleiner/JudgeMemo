Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative abruptly shifts between detailed character descriptions and sudden ghostly events without smooth transitions.
- [LOGIC] The ghost's actions and motivations are inconsistent, particularly his sudden vulnerability and emotional breakdowns.
- [CLARITY] The resolution involving Virginia and the ghost is introduced with little prior setup, making it feel abrupt and underdeveloped.
- [TRANSITION] There are jarring transitions between chapters, especially when moving from lighthearted American humor to the ghost's dramatic emotional turmoil.
- [COHERENCE] The overall narrative lacks a consistent tone, oscillating between satirical humor and Gothic horror without clear thematic integration.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
