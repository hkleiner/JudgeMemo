- [TRANSITION] There are no clear signposts or transitional phrases to guide the reader through the complex narrative and analysis.
- [COHERENCE] The text attempts to analyze a mystery novel and present multiple theories, but these theories are not always clearly distinguished or presented in a logical sequence.
- [LOGIC] The text presents various interpretations of the novel's plot but does not always provide a clear rationale for preferring one interpretation over another.
