Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is overly long and dense, with multiple nested arguments that make it difficult to follow the main thread of the discussion.  
- [CLARITY] Some sections are repetitive, particularly in the explanation of doctrinal distinctions, which could be condensed for better clarity.  
- [LOGIC] The argument shifts abruptly between theological explanations, historical context, and critiques of opposing views, which disrupts the logical flow.  
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between sections and paragraphs are weak or absent, making it hard to track the progression of ideas.  
- [COHERENCE] The text lacks a clear, unified structure that ties together its various parts into a cohesive whole, especially between doctrinal explanations and historical references.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
