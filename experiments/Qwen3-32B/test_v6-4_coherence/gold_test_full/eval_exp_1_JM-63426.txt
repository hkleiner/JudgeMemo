Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text is structured as a biography with multiple chapters, but the transitions between chapters are abrupt and lack connecting narrative.
- [LOGIC] Some sections jump chronologically without clear indication of time passage, making it difficult to follow the timeline of events.
- [CLARITY] The text frequently shifts between first-person narrative (Will Bradley's story) and third-person commentary (the introduction and afterword), without clear demarcation.
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the main narrative to the "A CHRONOLOGY" section is jarring and lacks any introductory explanation.
- [CONSISTENCY] The narrative voice is inconsistent, shifting between past tense and present tense within the same sections.
- [ORGANIZATION] The text contains multiple embedded narratives (the introduction, the biography, the afterword) that are not clearly separated or introduced.
- [COHESION] The "AN AFTERWORD" section at the end reads as a separate document rather than a natural conclusion to the biography.
- [PERSPECTIVE] The text mixes Will Bradley's first-person account with third-person biographical information without clear distinction.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
