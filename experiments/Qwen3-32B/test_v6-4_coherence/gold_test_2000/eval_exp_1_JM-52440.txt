Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and consistent structure; ideas are presented in a repetitive and meandering fashion without clear progression.  
- [LOGIC] The argument shifts between theological interpretation and doctrinal critique without clear logical transitions or unifying framework.  
- [CLARITY] Some concepts are ambiguously phrased, such as the distinction between "real presence" and "spiritual presence," which is not consistently clarified.  
- [TRANSITION] There are abrupt shifts between sections, particularly from the introduction to the doctrinal discussion, without sufficient transitional phrases.  
- [COHERENCE] The overall narrative lacks a unified focus, as it oscillates between defending the Church of England's doctrine, critiquing opposing views, and theological reflection without clear thematic cohesion.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
