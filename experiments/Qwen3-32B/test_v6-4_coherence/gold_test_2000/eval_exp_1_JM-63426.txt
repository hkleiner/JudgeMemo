Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text abruptly shifts between two distinct chapters with little or no transitional explanation.  
- [LOGIC] The second chapter reads like a fictionalized biography without clear indication that it is not factual, causing confusion about the author’s intent.  
- [CLARITY] The timeline in the second chapter is disjointed and lacks clear chronological markers, making it difficult to follow the subject’s development.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the introduction to the biographical chapter is abrupt and lacks coherence.  
- [CONSISTENCY] The tone and purpose of the text shift from a critical introduction to a narrative style, creating inconsistency in the reader’s expectations.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
