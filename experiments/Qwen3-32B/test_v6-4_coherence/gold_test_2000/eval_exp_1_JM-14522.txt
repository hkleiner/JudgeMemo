Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The sudden appearance of the ghost at one o'clock without prior foreshadowing or explanation disrupts the logical flow.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the family's arrival and setup to the ghost's first appearance feels abrupt and unprepared.  
- [CLARITY] The tone shifts from humorous and skeptical to supernatural without sufficient buildup, creating confusion for the reader.  
- [TRANSITION] The narrative jumps from the ghostâ€™s appearance to the twins' pillow attack with little connection or context.  
- [COHESION] The introduction of multiple characters and their traits does not smoothly lead into the ghost's introduction, creating a disjointed narrative.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
