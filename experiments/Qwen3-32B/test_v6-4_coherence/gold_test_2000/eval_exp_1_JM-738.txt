Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from the introduction of characters to the opening of the tale without clear transition.  
- [LOGIC] The timeline of events is occasionally unclear or confusing, particularly regarding the relationships and ages of the characters.  
- [CLARITY] Some descriptions are overly detailed and lack focus, making it difficult to follow the main narrative thread.  
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between different narrative sections are abrupt or missing, such as from the character list to the opening of the tale.  
- [LOGIC] The sudden introduction of the opium den and Jasper's hallucinations lacks sufficient context for the reader to fully understand their significance.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
