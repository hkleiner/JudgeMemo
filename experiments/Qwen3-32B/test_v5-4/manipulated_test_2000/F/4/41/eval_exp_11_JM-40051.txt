- [CLARITY] The text is often confusing and lacks clarity. The author frequently makes sweeping assertions without sufficient explanation or evidence.  
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between ideas and paragraphs are weak or nonexistent, making the flow of the narrative difficult to follow.  
- [LEXICON] The author uses archaic or overly poetic language that is inconsistent with the overall tone and can be distracting.  
- [SYNTAX] The sentence structure is often awkward or overly complex, which hinders readability.
