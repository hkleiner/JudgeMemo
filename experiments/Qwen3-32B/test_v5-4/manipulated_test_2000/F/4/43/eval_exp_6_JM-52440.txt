- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and consistent structure in some parts, making it difficult to follow the logical flow of the argument.  
- [CLARITY] Certain passages are overly complex and ambiguous, such as the discussion of the Real Presence and the distinction between spiritual and material feeding.  
- [LEXICON] Some word choices are awkward or inappropriate for the context, which hinders readability.  
- [LOGIC] There are logical inconsistencies in the argumentation, especially in the transition between the definitions of sacraments and the application to the Lordâ€™s Supper.
