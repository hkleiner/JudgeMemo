Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Several grammatically incorrect sentences, such as "I it at short ghost money that, as public time thing there we and or; have in I if all in can" and "The been-has and admired others blood be by tourists and, much canstain not removed."  
- [SYNTAX] Disjointed and non-parallel sentence structures, especially in the middle of the first chapter, where the text appears to be incoherent and lacks proper syntax.  
- [LOGIC] The transition between the first and second chapters is abrupt and lacks context. The second chapter starts with "raged The particular fiercely but II of, note that storm all night occurred," which is illogical and confusing.  
- [STRUCTURE] The second chapter is poorly structured and lacks a clear narrative flow. It begins with a jumbled sentence that disrupts the storyâ€™s continuity.  
- [CLARITY] Some parts of the text are unclear or ambiguous, especially in the middle of the first chapter where the language is incoherent.  
- [SPELLING] Minor spelling errors, such as "Otis had position" and "Umney 's, in to Mrs., consented Mrs. herLady housekeeper whom," which disrupt the reading experience.  
- [LEXICON] Use of inappropriate or inconsistent word choices, especially in the incoherent section of the first chapter, where the text seems to be a random string of words.
