Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The story is a jumbled mix of unrelated narratives and topics, including a supposed discovery of the Garden of Eden, a romantic plot involving Jasper, Rosa, and Edwin, and a scene from a haunted house or Tudor setting, with no logical connection between them.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative lacks logical progression; the transition from the Garden of Eden to a love triangle and then to a scene in a library is abrupt and disjointed.  
- [CLARITY] The text is confusing and lacks a clear central theme or focus, making it difficult to determine the intended message or story.  
- [SPELLING] There are several spelling errors, such as "antldiluvians", "admirirg", "dimentions", "antideluvians", and "consitutes".  
- [GRAMMAR] There are grammatical errors, such as missing articles ("He made her aware of his passion, silently"), incorrect verb tenses ("have been opening to the minds of some"), and awkward phrasing ("have ventured to publish it").  
- [SYNTAX] The sentence structure is often awkward and convoluted, making the text difficult to follow.  
- [LEXICON] Some word choices are imprecise or inappropriate for the context, such as "euphony of those names" and "the bloom is off the plum".  
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and sections are abrupt and lack smooth flow, making the text feel fragmented.
