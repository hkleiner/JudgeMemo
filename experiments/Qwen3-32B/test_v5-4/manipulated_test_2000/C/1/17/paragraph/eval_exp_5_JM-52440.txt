Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The story lacks a clear narrative structure and appears to be a collection of unrelated excerpts or fragments from different texts, including theological discussions and ghost story snippets.  
- [LOGIC] There is no logical progression between the sections; the transitions are abrupt and disconnected.  
- [COHERENCE] The content jumps between a theological debate about the Church of England, a ghost story, and a personal narrative about George Stransom and Kate Creston, making it difficult to follow a single storyline or theme.  
- [CLARITY] The purpose and focus of the text are unclear, and it is not evident how the different parts relate to one another.  
- [SPELLING] Minor spelling errors, such as "fumes of liquor" (awkward phrasing, though not strictly a spelling error), and inconsistent formatting (e.g., "CHAPTER: INTRODUCTION" vs. "CHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE").  
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and complex, making them difficult to follow, especially in the theological section.  
- [LEXICON] Some words and phrases are used in a very formal or archaic manner, which may hinder readability for some readers.
