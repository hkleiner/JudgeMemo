Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The story abruptly shifts from the introduction about Will Bradley to a completely unrelated narrative involving Stransom, Mary Antrim, and Paul Creston, which feels disconnected and unexplained.  
- [LOGIC] The transition from discussing Bradley’s impact on typography to a seemingly unrelated anecdote about a jeweler’s shop and characters with no prior introduction is jarring and illogical.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of “Sir Simon” and the blood-stain at the Chase appears out of nowhere, with no prior setup or relevance to the surrounding narrative.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the introduction to the chapter "The Boy Printer of Ishpeeming" is abrupt and lacks a smooth narrative bridge.  
- [SPELLING] "Ishpeeming" is misspelled as "Ishpeming" in the chapter title.  
- [SYNTAX] "The two jobbers are kicked" is grammatically unclear and awkward.  
- [LEXICON] "Narrow Gauge" and "picklelime" are used without explanation, making them confusing for the reader.  
- [GRAMMAR] "Having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay of a lower-case" is ungrammatical and awkwardly phrased.  
- [LOGIC] The story introduces multiple characters and events without establishing their relevance to the main subject, Will Bradley.  
- [COHERENCE] The narrative includes multiple disjointed segments that do not clearly connect to the central theme of Bradley’s life and work.
