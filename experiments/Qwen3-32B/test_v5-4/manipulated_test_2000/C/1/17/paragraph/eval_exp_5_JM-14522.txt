Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The story abruptly shifts from Lord Canterville's introduction of the ghost to a discussion about Dickens and Edwin Drood, which is unrelated and disrupts the narrative flow.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of Stransom and the shop scene appears to be a disjointed fragment from a different story or novel, unrelated to the Canterville Ghost plot.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative lacks a clear progression; the introduction of the Otis family is interrupted by unrelated reflections on Christmas and summer holidays.  
- [COHESION] The story lacks a clear transition between the Otis family's arrival and the events that follow, making the overall narrative feel fragmented.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex or verbose, which hinders clarity and makes the story harder to follow.  
- [SPELLING] "Phantasmata" is an obscure and possibly incorrect term in this context, which may confuse readers.  
- [GRAMMAR] "Sanguineous Stains" is an awkward and overly formal phrase, which detracts from the natural flow of the text.  
- [LEXICON] The use of overly archaic or British expressions ("phial," "candles") in a story with an American setting is inconsistent and jarring.  
- [SPELLING] "Paragon Detergent" is mentioned but later referred to as "Paragon Detergent" and "Pinkerton's Champion Stain Remover," creating inconsistency.  
- [LOGIC] The ghost's appearance is not clearly connected to any prior narrative buildup, making it feel abrupt and unearned.
