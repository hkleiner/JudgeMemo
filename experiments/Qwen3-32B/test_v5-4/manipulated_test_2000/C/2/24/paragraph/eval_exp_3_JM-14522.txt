Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "phantasmata" is an obscure or incorrect word in this context; "phantasms" or "ghosts" would be more appropriate.  
- [SYNTAX] "He was quite calm, and felt his pulse, which was not at all feverish." – the sentence is grammatically correct but awkward in phrasing.  
- [LEXICON] "The sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the London drawl." – the phrase is slightly ambiguous and could be rephrased for clarity.  
- [STRUCTURE] The story is well-structured, but some paragraphs are very long and could benefit from better paragraphing to improve readability.  
- [LOGIC] The reappearance of the blood stain is explained, but the transition from Washington's scientific attitude to the supernatural events could be smoother.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the family's dinner conversation to Mr. Otis encountering the ghost is abrupt and could be better connected.  
- [SPELLING] "sanguineous" is a rare and possibly overcomplicated word that may confuse some readers.  
- [CLARITY] "I have always been of opinion that emigration is the only thing for England." – the phrasing is awkward and could be clearer.
