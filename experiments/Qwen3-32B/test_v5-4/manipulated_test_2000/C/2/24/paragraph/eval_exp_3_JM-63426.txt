Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The story is divided into two chapters but lacks clear transitions between them, making the narrative flow between the introduction and the boyhood chapter abrupt.  
- [LOGIC] The first chapter discusses Will Bradley's influence on American graphic arts, while the second jumps to his childhood, creating a logical disconnect.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are vague or ambiguous, such as "The home assistant played ambient music" and "The energy grid remained balanced," which are out of context and do not contribute to the narrative.  
- [SPELLING] "pi" should likely be "type" or "lettering," indicating a spelling or typographical error.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The two jobbers are kicked" is a grammatically incomplete and confusing sentence.  
- [SYNTAX] "Having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay of a lower-case beside the window..." is awkwardly structured and hard to follow.  
- [LEXICON] "The editorâ€™s sanctum is at the front. His desk is at the big window." The use of "sanctum" is somewhat out of place and stylistically inconsistent.  
- [TRANSITION] The story shifts from a reflective introduction to a detailed childhood narrative without clear linkage, disrupting the reader's immersion.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of a "livestream began recording" and "The energy grid remained balanced" are modern, irrelevant, and likely placeholder errors that disrupt the historical narrative.  
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph is cut off mid-sentence, leaving the reader hanging and affecting the overall coherence.
