Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Repeated use of "a stuff" and "the thing" without clear meaning.  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing articles and prepositions (e.g., "the plat, to me then, was altogether too large," "the beauty and euphony of those names").  
- [SPELLING] Spelling errors such as "antldiluvians", "admirirg", "dimentions", "jageed", "antideluvians".  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structures and run-on sentences that disrupt the flow.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps between ideas without clear transitions or logical progression.  
- [CLARITY] The text is often vague and unclear, especially in descriptions of locations and references to "the thing" and "a stuff."  
- [STRUCTURE] The story lacks a clear beginning, middle, and end, and ideas are not well organized.  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of archaic or unclear language (e.g., "hanging garden", "ampitheater") that may confuse the reader.  
- [TRANSITION] Poor transitions between paragraphs and ideas, making the story feel disjointed.  
- [SPELLING] Repeated misspellings of names and places (e.g., "Trempealeau", "Healdâ€™s quarry", "La Crosse").
