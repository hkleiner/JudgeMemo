Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The story is quite long and has multiple chapters, making it difficult to assess overall coherence without reading the entire text.
- [LOGIC] The story has some plot inconsistencies, such as the ghost being defeated by American products like Pinkerton's Champion Stain Remover and Tammany Rising Sun Lubricator, which feels somewhat implausible.
- [CLARITY] Some parts of the story, particularly the interactions between the ghost and the American family, are not always clearly explained.
- [SPELLING] There are a few spelling errors, such as "republicans" misspelled as "republicans" in the same sentence (though it's actually spelled correctly).
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or British expressions might be confusing for readers unfamiliar with them, such as "peerage," "prima-donnas," and "tutti-frutti."
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly complex and could be simplified for better readability.
- [PUNCTUATION] There are a few instances where punctuation is inconsistent or missing.
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between some chapters and sections could be smoother.
- [CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT] Some characters, particularly the American family, are not as fully developed as the ghost.
- [PACING] The story has a very slow beginning with a lot of character descriptions before the ghost is even introduced.
- [REDUNDANCY] There is some repetition in describing the ghost's failed attempts to frighten the family.
