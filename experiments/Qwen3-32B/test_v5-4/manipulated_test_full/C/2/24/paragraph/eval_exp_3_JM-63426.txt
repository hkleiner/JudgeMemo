Issues: 
- [COHERENCE] The story is highly detailed and complex, with a non-linear structure that jumps between different periods in Will Bradley's life. This can make it difficult for readers to follow the overall narrative arc.
- [COHERENCE] The story often shifts abruptly between different topics and time periods without clear transitions, which can disrupt the reader's understanding of the chronology and relationships between events.
- [COHERENCE] Some sections are overly detailed and contain information that is not directly relevant to the main narrative, which can distract from the central story of Will Bradley's life and career.
- [COHERENCE] The story occasionally uses a second-person narrative voice ("you are six years old") that shifts to a first-person voice ("I agreed to write an introduction") without clear explanation, which can be confusing for readers.
- [FLUENCY] There are occasional grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as "The motion sensor caught a brief movement" and "The scanning module aligned with the grid," which seem out of place in the otherwise well-written text.
- [FLUENCY] Some sentences are overly complex and contain multiple clauses, which can make them difficult to parse and understand.
- [FLUENCY] The text contains some anachronistic references, such as "A GPS signal recalibrated" and "A camera lens refocused itself," which are out of place in a historical narrative.
- [FLUENCY] The text occasionally uses archaic or unusual language that may be difficult for modern readers to understand, such as "You have a little express wagon" and "Your father is drawing cartoons for a Lynn daily--perhaps the Daily Item."
