Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The story has some logical inconsistencies, such as the ghost being defeated by modern American products like Pinkerton's Champion Stain Remover and Tammany Rising Sun Lubricator, which is an unusual and somewhat jarring concept.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative is generally well-structured, but the story could have benefited from more transitions between the chapters to improve the flow.
- [CLARITY] Some parts of the story are not entirely clear, particularly the references to modern technology (e.g., "deepfake filter," "wireless charger," "AI core") that seem out of place in an otherwise 19th-century setting.
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between chapters are abrupt, with no clear indication of how the events in one chapter lead to the next.
- [LEXICON] There are some anachronistic or modern terms that do not fit the historical setting of the story, such as "self-driving cart" and "biosensor."
- [SYNTAX] The syntax is mostly correct and appropriate for the narrative style, but there are occasional awkward phrasings, such as "The autonomous vehicle waited at the curb."
- [SPELLING] There are no spelling errors detected in the text.
- [GRAMMAR] The grammar is generally correct, with only a few minor issues that do not significantly affect comprehension.
