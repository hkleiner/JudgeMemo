Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The story is very long and contains many chapters with repetitive themes and ideas, making it difficult to follow the overall narrative arc.
- [LOGIC] There are numerous logical gaps and unclear transitions between events, especially in the early chapters about Will Bradley's childhood and early career.
- [CLARITY] Many specific references are unclear due to missing context (e.g., "the thing," "a stuff").
- [SPELLING] There are occasional spelling errors and typos (e.g., "stuf" instead of "stuff").
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are awkwardly constructed and difficult to parse.
- [LEXICON] The text contains many vague or placeholder words like "the stuff" and "a thing" that make the narrative confusing.
- [COHESION] The narrative lacks consistent perspective - it shifts between first-person and third-person narration without clear transitions.
- [REPETITION] The story frequently repeats information about Will Bradley's career and accomplishments.
- [PUNCTUATION] There are occasional punctuation errors that disrupt the flow of the text.
