Issues: 
- [COHERENCE] The story is a long, detailed biography of Will Bradley, but the narrative lacks a clear structure and logical progression. The chapters jump back and forth in time without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow Bradley's life chronologically.
- [COHERENCE] There are numerous abrupt shifts in perspective, often switching between first-person and third-person narration without clear indication of when these shifts occur.
- [COHERENCE] The story lacks a central narrative thread or purpose, reading more like a collection of disconnected anecdotes rather than a cohesive biography.
- [COHERENCE] The final "Afterword" section introduces new information not previously mentioned in the story, creating a disjointed conclusion.
- [FLUENCY] There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the text, including subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect verb tenses, and missing articles.
- [FLUENCY] The text contains many awkward phrasings and sentence structures, such as "You are now a working man--wages three dollars a week" and "He is an inveterate sportsman in a land where game, deer and fish, is plentiful."
- [FLUENCY] The punctuation is inconsistent and often incorrect, with missing commas and periods that disrupt the flow of the text.
- [FLUENCY] There are numerous misspellings and typographical errors, such as "tongues of high, lace shoes" and "He may had had some such idea."
- [FLUENCY] The text frequently uses archaic or overly formal language that is inconsistent with the casual, conversational tone of much of the narrative.
