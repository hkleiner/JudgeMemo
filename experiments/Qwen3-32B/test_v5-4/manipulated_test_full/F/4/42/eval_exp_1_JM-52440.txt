Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Several grammatical errors such as incorrect verb forms (e.g., "In did this" instead of "In doing this", "we was taught" instead of "we were taught").  
- [SPELLING] Spelling errors such as "was" instead of "were", "describe" instead of "described", "concluded" instead of "conclude".  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward and complex sentence structures that make the text difficult to follow.  
- [LOGIC] Some logical inconsistencies or abrupt shifts in the argumentation, especially in the long theological discussions.  
- [STRUCTURE] The structure is generally coherent as it follows a logical progression through different chapters and arguments, but the length and complexity of the text can make it hard to track the flow.  
- [CLARITY] Some concepts are expressed in a highly complex and archaic manner, making them less clear to modern readers.  
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and sections are generally smooth, but the dense and technical content can make the flow feel abrupt at times.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
