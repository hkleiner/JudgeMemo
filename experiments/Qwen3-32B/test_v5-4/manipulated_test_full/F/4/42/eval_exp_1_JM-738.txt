Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The story is very long and complex, making it difficult to follow the plot and character relationships without careful attention. The introduction of many characters and subplots makes it challenging to maintain coherence throughout.
- [CLARITY] Some parts of the story are ambiguous or require prior knowledge of Dickens's works to fully understand the references and context.
- [LOGIC] There are several logical inconsistencies and plot holes, particularly in the theories and interpretations of the mystery. The story presents multiple conflicting theories about what happened to Edwin Drood, making it difficult to determine a clear resolution.
- [SPELLING] There are several spelling errors throughout the text, such as "coulded" instead of "could", "was" instead of "is", and "mak sikker" instead of "make sure".
- [GRAMMAR] There are numerous grammatical errors, including incorrect verb tenses, missing articles, and awkward phrasing. For example, "He woulded excuse himself" and "He would not have changed countenance on hearing a fact he had known six months previously."
- [SYNTAX] The sentence structure is often complex and difficult to follow, with long, convoluted sentences that can be confusing to the reader.
- [LEXICON] The vocabulary is generally appropriate for the content, but some word choices are awkward or unclear in context.
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between sections and ideas are sometimes abrupt or unclear, making it difficult to follow the flow of the narrative.
- [CONSISTENCY] The story presents multiple theories about the mystery of Edwin Drood, which can be confusing and contradictory. The lack of a clear, consistent narrative makes it difficult to determine the author's intended resolution.
