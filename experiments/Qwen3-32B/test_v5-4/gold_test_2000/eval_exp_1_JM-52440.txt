Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is a formal theological treatise with dense arguments and long paragraphs, making it difficult to follow for a general reader.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and abstract, which may obscure the meaning for readers unfamiliar with theological terminology.  
- [LOGIC] While the argument is logically structured in terms of topic progression, some transitions between paragraphs are abrupt or unclear.  
- [SYNTAX] A few sentences contain awkward phrasing or run-on constructions that hinder readability.  
- [LEXICON] The use of archaic or highly specialized language may be a barrier to fluency for some readers.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Some sentences have inconsistent or excessive use of commas, making them harder to parse.
