Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "I have come from a modern country, where we have everything that money can buy" – the relative clause "where" is misused; "where" refers to a place, but "country" is used abstractly here.  
- [GRAMMAR] "with all our spry young fellows painting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and prima-donnas" – comma splice.  
- [GRAMMAR] "I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in Europe, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public museums, or on the road as a show" – awkward phrasing and redundancy.  
- [SPELLING] "prima-donnas" – correct, but could be hyphenated as "prima donnas" in British English.  
- [SYNTAX] "I will take the furniture and the ghost at a valuation" – ambiguous phrasing.  
- [LEXICON] "painting the Old World red" – idiomatically unclear.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative is generally well-structured, but the transition from the Otis family's introduction to the ghost's appearance is slightly abrupt.  
- [LOGIC] The ghost's return of the bloodstain is not clearly explained, but it is consistent with the ghost's established role.  
- [CLARITY] "The conversation in no way turned upon ghosts" – slightly awkward phrasing.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the family's evening drive to the ghost's appearance is smooth.  
- [SPELLING] "phantasmata" – correct but uncommon and potentially confusing to some readers.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The conversation in no way turned upon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of receptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of psychical phenomena" – overly complex and wordy.
