Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing articles and prepositions, e.g., “He, evidently, must place him somewhere,” “the Euphrates river crosses that country, that ‘eastward’,” “the soil is not a deep, rich paste, like the American bottoms opposite St. Louis, on the same river, which is known to be the richest land in the world.”  
- [SPELLING] Spelling errors such as “admirirg,” “dimentions,” “antldiluvians,” “antideluvians,” “Bridtish,” “jageed,” “euphony.”  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward or overly complex sentence structures, e.g., “But having become thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured to publish it.”  
- [LEXICON] Inconsistent or unclear word choices, e.g., “the fabled dog,” “the fabled dog, ‘they grabbed for the shadow and lost the reality.’”  
- [LOGIC] Some logical leaps and unclear reasoning, e.g., the connection between the geography of the Mississippi and the Garden of Eden is speculative and not clearly supported.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between descriptions, claims, and historical references without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] Some ideas are vague or ambiguous, e.g., “the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the ‘North West’ as the place.”  
- [TRANSITION] Poor transitions between paragraphs, especially between the author’s claims and the descriptions of the landscape.
