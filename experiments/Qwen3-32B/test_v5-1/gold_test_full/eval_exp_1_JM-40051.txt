Analysis: The story is written in a very old-fashioned and verbose style, with numerous grammatical errors, misspellings, and awkward phrasing. It contains run-on sentences, inconsistent punctuation, and frequent typos (e.g., "antldiluvians," "admirirg," "dimentions"). These issues significantly affect the fluency of the text. In terms of coherence, the story presents a narrative that attempts to identify the Garden of Eden in a specific geographical location, but it lacks a clear structure, with ideas presented in a disjointed and repetitive manner. The logical flow is often unclear, and the narrative jumps between descriptions of geography, religious interpretations, and historical claims without clear transitions.
