Analysis: The story is a theological text discussing the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. The writing is largely coherent, with a clear structure and logical progression of ideas. The argument is well-organized, with distinct sections and a consistent narrative about the nature of the sacrament. However, there are some minor issues with coherence, such as the repetition of phrases and the occasional abrupt shift in focus. In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written with correct grammar and syntax. However, there are a few awkward phrasings and unclear expressions that slightly disrupt the smooth flow of the language.
