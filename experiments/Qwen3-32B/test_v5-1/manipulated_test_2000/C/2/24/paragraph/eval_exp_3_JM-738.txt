The plot is presented in a coherent manner, with a clear introduction of characters and events that follow a logical sequence. However, the text contains some awkward phrasing and minor grammatical inconsistencies that slightly affect the fluency. Word choice and sentence structure are mostly appropriate, though a few phrases feel overly complex or archaic.
