Analysis: The story is mostly fluent, with only a few grammatical and syntactical errors, such as in the paragraph where Washington Otis speaks about "I it at short ghost money that, as public time thing there we and or; have in I if all in can..." which is incoherent and disrupts the fluency. The majority of the text is well-written with appropriate word choice and phrasing. The story is generally coherent, following a logical sequence of events, and maintaining a clear narrative progression. However, the incoherent paragraph and the title "CHAPTER: nothing" disrupt the overall coherence of the story.

Rating:  
Feedback: The story is mostly fluent with only minor grammatical issues, though one paragraph is incoherent. The narrative is generally coherent but is disrupted by the incoherent paragraph and an odd chapter title.  
FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
