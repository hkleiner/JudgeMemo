Analysis: The story is generally coherent, with a clear narrative progression that follows the life of Will Bradley and his impact on American graphic arts. However, there are a few instances of abrupt transitions and some unclear or loosely connected ideas, particularly in the second chapter, which may affect overall cohesion. The text is mostly fluent, with well-formed sentences and appropriate word choice, though there are a few grammatical errors, awkward phrasings, and minor punctuation issues that disrupt the smooth reading experience.
