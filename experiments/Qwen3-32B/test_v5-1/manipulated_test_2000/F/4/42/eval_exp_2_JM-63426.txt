Analysis: The story is well-structured and logically progresses through the life and impact of Will Bradley, with a clear narrative flow and consistent themes. Ideas are connected smoothly and the transition between sections is effective, contributing to a high level of coherence. The language is generally fluent, with only minor grammatical and syntactical errors (e.g., "It shoulded be talked about," "he may had had," "you was"). These do not significantly disrupt the readability but could be improved for higher fluency.
