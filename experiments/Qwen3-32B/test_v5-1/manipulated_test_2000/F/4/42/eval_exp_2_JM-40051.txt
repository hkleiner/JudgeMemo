Analysis: The story is written in a formal and archaic style, which may affect its fluency due to inconsistent grammar, spelling, and phrasing (e.g., "had venture to published it," "but of this last fact I is ignorant"). Despite these issues, the narrative maintains a clear structure and logical progression, with a consistent focus on the author's discovery and the location of the Garden of Eden. Ideas are well connected and the overall argument is coherent, even if the language is awkward at times.

Rating:  
FINAL Coherence Score: 4
