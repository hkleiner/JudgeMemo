Analysis: The story is written in a narrative style that is mostly coherent, with a clear progression of events and a logical sequence of ideas. The plot follows the arrival of the Otis family at Canterville Chase and the initial encounter with the ghost. However, there are some minor inconsistencies and awkward transitions, particularly in the pacing and the sudden introduction of certain elements. The story also contains some grammatical errors, such as incorrect verb tenses and subject-verb agreement issues, which slightly affect fluency. Despite these issues, the language is generally clear and the narrative is easy to follow.
