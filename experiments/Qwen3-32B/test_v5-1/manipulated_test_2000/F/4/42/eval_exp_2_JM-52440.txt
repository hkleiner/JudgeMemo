Analysis: The text is highly coherent, with a clear structure, logical progression, and consistent development of ideas. The narrative follows a well-defined argument, with each section building upon the previous one. However, there are several grammatical errors, such as incorrect verb forms ("am the true expositors," "was the real point at issue," "we was taught"), misspellings ("bless Saviour"), and awkward phrasing, which affect fluency. Despite these issues, the overall readability is not severely impaired.  
Rating: 3

Feedback: The text is coherent with a clear and structured argument, but it contains multiple grammatical errors, incorrect verb forms, and awkward phrasing that impact fluency.  
FINAL Coherence Score: 5
