Feedback: The story is highly coherent, with a clear narrative structure and logical progression of events. The plot unfolds smoothly, with well-connected ideas and a consistent storyline. However, the language is archaic and dense, making it challenging to read in parts. There are some awkward phrasings and complex sentence structures that affect fluency. The story is well-written overall but could benefit from more modern and accessible language.

FINAL Coherence Score: 5
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
