Analysis: The story is a dense theological treatise examining the Church of England's doctrine regarding the Lord's Supper, particularly in relation to the Real Presence, adoration, and sacrifice. It is written in a formal, archaic style with complex sentence structures and theological terminology. The narrative is highly coherent, as it follows a clear logical progression across chapters, maintaining a consistent argument and purpose. The text is well-structured, with each section building upon the previous one. However, the fluency is somewhat hindered by archaic phrasing, occasional awkward syntax, and some repetition. The language is not always modern or easy to follow, which may affect readability, though it does not impede understanding for those familiar with theological discourse.

Rating: Coherence - 5, Fluency - 3
