Feedback: The story is highly coherent, with a well-structured narrative that logically unfolds the mystery of Dickens's last plot. The ideas are smoothly connected, and the progression from one section to another is clear and consistent. The story avoids ambiguities and abrupt jumps, maintaining a focused and structured approach throughout. In terms of fluency, the text is written in a sophisticated and complex style, with some archaic and unusual phrasing that may slightly disrupt the flow for modern readers. There are a few instances of awkward phrasing and some unusual word choices, but overall the language is grammatically sound and reads well. 

FINAL Coherence Score: 5  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
