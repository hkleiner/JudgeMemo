Analysis: The story is written in a formal, narrative style with rich vocabulary and complex sentence structures. It maintains a clear chronological progression through the life of Will Bradley, a designer and printer. The text is well-organized with clear transitions between chapters and sections. The narrative is consistent and avoids abrupt jumps. However, there are occasional grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that slightly affect fluency. The vocabulary is generally appropriate and the sentences flow well, though some sentences are overly complex and could be simplified for better readability.

Rating: Coherence - 4, Fluency - 3
