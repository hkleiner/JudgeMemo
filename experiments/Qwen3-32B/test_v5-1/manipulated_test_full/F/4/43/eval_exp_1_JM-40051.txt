Feedback: The story is highly incoherent due to numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and disjointed ideas. It lacks a clear narrative progression and is filled with confusing and repetitive content. The text is difficult to follow and often seems to jump between ideas without logical connections. Fluency is also poor, with many misspellings, incorrect word usage, and sentence structure issues that hinder readability.
