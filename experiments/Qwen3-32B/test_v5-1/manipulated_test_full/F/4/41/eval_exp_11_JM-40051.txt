Analysis: The story is written in a somewhat archaic and inconsistent style, with frequent spelling and grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and punctuation issues. These problems affect the fluency, making the text difficult to read at times. In terms of coherence, the narrative is loosely structured and meanders through various descriptions, historical references, and speculative claims without a clear or logical progression. While the central idea of locating the Garden of Eden is present, the story lacks a focused development of that idea, and the transitions between ideas are often abrupt or unclear.

Rating:  
FINAL Coherence Score: 2
