Analysis: The story is a well-structured theological treatise on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. It demonstrates high coherence, with a clear and logical progression of ideas, well-defined sections, and smooth transitions between topics. The arguments are methodically presented and follow a consistent structure. The text is also highly fluent, with minimal grammatical errors, proper punctuation, and appropriate word choice. The only minor issues are occasional spelling errors and some awkward phrasing, but these do not significantly impede readability.
