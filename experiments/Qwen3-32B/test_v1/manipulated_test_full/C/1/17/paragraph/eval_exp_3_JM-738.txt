The text is a complex and detailed literary analysis of *The Mystery of Edwin Drood* by Charles Dickens. It is generally fluent, with well-constructed sentences and correct grammar. The writing style is academic and dense, with long, complex sentences that are mostly clear and well-formed. There are occasional instances of awkward phrasing or abrupt transitions, but these are relatively minor and do not significantly impede readability.

In terms of coherence, the text is less consistent. While it presents a logical progression of ideas and theories about the novel, the structure is somewhat fragmented. The text jumps between different theories, analyses, and interpretations without always providing clear transitions or signposts. Some paragraphs begin abruptly or seem disconnected from the previous content. The text also contains some extraneous or loosely connected material, such as references to unrelated topics like Millet's art or Kaffir superiority, which can disrupt the flow of the main argument.

Overall, the text is well-written and informative, but its coherence could be improved with clearer organization and more consistent transitions between ideas.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
