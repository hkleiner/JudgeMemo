The text is a theological treatise examining the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper, particularly the Real Presence, adoration, and sacrifice. The fluency of the text is high, with well-constructed sentences, correct grammar, and precise vocabulary. The writing is formal and academic, and the author uses complex sentence structures effectively without sacrificing clarity. However, the coherence is somewhat lower due to the occasional abrupt shifts in subject, such as the unexpected mention of characters like "Princess Puffer" and unrelated narrative fragments like the one involving "Millet." These disruptions break the logical flow of the argument, making the text feel disjointed in places. Despite these issues, the core argument is generally well-organized and logically developed.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
