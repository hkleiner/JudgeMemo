The text is highly uneven in quality. Fluency is inconsistent: some sentences are well-written and grammatically correct, while others contain errors, awkward phrasing, and run-on constructions. Coherence is also problematic; the narrative jumps between topics without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow a central argument or theme. The text combines biblical interpretation, geographical description, and speculative claims in a disorganized manner, lacking a logical progression or unifying structure.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
