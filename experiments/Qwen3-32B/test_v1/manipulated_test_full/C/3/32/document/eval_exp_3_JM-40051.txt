The text is a long, elaborate, and highly verbose description of a supposed location of the Garden of Eden in the American Midwest. Regarding **fluency**, the writing is generally well-structured at the sentence level, with complex and often poetic language. However, it contains numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and inconsistencies in word usage (e.g., "a stuff," "the thing"). Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, making them difficult to follow. Despite these issues, the prose is mostly readable and maintains a coherent tone.

Regarding **coherence**, the text lacks a clear and logical progression of ideas. It jumps between descriptions of the landscape, theological interpretations, historical references, and comparisons to other theories, often without clear transitions. The argument is repetitive and circular, and the author's enthusiasm and conviction do not compensate for the lack of structured reasoning. While the overall theme is clear, the disorganization and lack of focus significantly reduce the text's coherence.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
