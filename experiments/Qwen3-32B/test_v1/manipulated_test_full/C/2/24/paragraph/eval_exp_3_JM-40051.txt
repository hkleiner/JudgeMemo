The story is a long, elaborate, and somewhat eccentric account of a claimed discovery of the Garden of Eden in the American Midwest. Regarding **fluency**, the text is generally well-written with complex sentence structures and rich vocabulary, though it contains numerous minor grammatical errors, misspellings (e.g., "antldiluvians," "admirirg," "dimentions"), and awkward phrasing. These issues reduce the overall fluency slightly. Regarding **coherence**, the story lacks a clear and logical progression. It jumps between descriptive passages, theological interpretations, historical claims, and personal anecdotes without clear transitions. The author frequently digresses and repeats points, making it difficult to follow the central argument. The text appears more as a collection of loosely connected ideas rather than a unified narrative.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
