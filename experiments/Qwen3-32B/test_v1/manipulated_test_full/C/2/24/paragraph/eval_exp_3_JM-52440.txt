The text is a detailed theological treatise on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. It is well-written, with complex ideas expressed in a formal and academic style. The sentences are grammatically correct and well-structured, showing a high level of fluency. However, the text is extremely dense and specialized, making it difficult for a general reader to follow. The coherence is strong within each section, as the author carefully builds arguments and supports them with references to church documents. However, the overall structure of the text could be improved with clearer transitions between sections and a more explicit roadmap for the reader.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
FINAL Fluency Score: 5
