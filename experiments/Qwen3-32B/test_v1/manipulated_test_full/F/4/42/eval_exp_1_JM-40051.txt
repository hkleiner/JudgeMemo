The story is a long, detailed, and highly verbose description of a supposed location of the Garden of Eden in the American Midwest. In terms of fluency, the text contains many grammatical errors, awkward phrasings, and inconsistent verb tenses. There are numerous misspellings (e.g., "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians," "admirirg" instead of "admiring," "dimentions" instead of "dimensions") and punctuation issues that hinder readability. The sentences often run on without clear structure.

Regarding coherence, the text attempts to build a case for the author's discovery of the Garden of Eden, but the organization is poor. The flow of ideas is disjointed, with frequent shifts in topic and an overabundance of tangential details. The central argument is buried under excessive descriptions of the landscape and speculative theological interpretations. The reader is left confused about the main points due to the lack of logical progression and the overwhelming amount of information.
