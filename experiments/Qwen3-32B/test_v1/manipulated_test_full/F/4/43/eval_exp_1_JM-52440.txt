The text is a detailed and theological exposition of the Church of England's doctrine regarding the Lord's Supper, particularly addressing the Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice. It is well-structured, with a clear introduction and division into chapters, and each section logically follows the previous one. The arguments are presented in a coherent and systematic manner, making it easy to follow the author's reasoning and intent. However, the language is complex, with archaic phrasing and theological terminology, which may make it difficult for some readers to fully grasp. Despite this, the text remains internally consistent and logically flows from one point to the next.

Regarding fluency, the text contains occasional grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as fragmented sentences or misplaced words, which can disrupt the reading experience. For example, phrases like "If be not adored living therein the can He in elementsbe not a Saviour" are clearly flawed. However, these issues are relatively infrequent and do not significantly impede understanding for the most part. The writing is formal and dense, which is appropriate for the subject matter, but it could benefit from clearer sentence structure and more modern phrasing to improve readability.
