The story is a well-written, coherent adaptation of Oscar Wilde's "The Canterville Ghost," with a clear narrative structure and logical progression of events. The plot flows smoothly, with each chapter building upon the previous one, and the characters are well-developed and consistent. However, some parts of the text contain grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and occasional incoherent sentences, particularly in dialogue and descriptive passages. These issues affect the fluency but do not significantly disrupt the overall understanding of the story.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
