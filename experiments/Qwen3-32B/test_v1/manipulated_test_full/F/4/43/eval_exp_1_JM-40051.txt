The text is a long, highly idiosyncratic, and often incoherent description of a claimed "Garden of Eden" located in the American Midwest. While it contains some well-formed sentences and descriptive language, the overall fluency is low due to frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and non-standard word order. Coherence is also poor, as the narrative is disorganized, jumps between ideas, and lacks a clear logical progression. The author's enthusiasm and repetitive claims are evident, but the lack of structure and clarity severely undermines the text's overall quality.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
