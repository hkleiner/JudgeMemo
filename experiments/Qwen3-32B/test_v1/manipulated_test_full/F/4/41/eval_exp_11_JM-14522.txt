The story is generally fluent, with well-structured sentences and mostly correct grammar, although there are some typographical errors (e.g., "biught" instead of "bought," "alk" instead of "all," "eferor" instead of "error"). These minor issues slightly disrupt the reading experience but do not impede comprehension. The narrative is coherent, with a clear progression of events and a logical flow from chapter to chapter. The characters and setting are well-developed, and the plot is engaging and consistent, making it easy to follow the story's development and the interactions between the Otis family and the Canterville Ghost. The themes of cultural contrast and redemption are effectively woven into the narrative.

FINAL Coherence Score: 5
