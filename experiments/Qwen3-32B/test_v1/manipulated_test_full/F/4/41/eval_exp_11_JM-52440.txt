The text is a detailed theological treatise on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. In terms of **fluency**, the text is generally well-written, with complex ideas expressed in a formal, academic tone. However, there are several minor grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., "ans place reliance," "vlindly given," "experiejced," "het that"). These errors, while not severely disruptive, affect the overall fluency of the prose.

Regarding **coherence**, the text is highly structured and logically organized. It begins with an introduction, followed by three main chapters that systematically examine the doctrine of the Real Presence, adoration, and sacrifice. Each section builds on the previous one, and the argument is clearly developed with references to authoritative documents like the Articles, Catechism, and Homilies. The argument is consistent and well-supported, making the text coherent and persuasive.
