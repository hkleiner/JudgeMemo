The text is a detailed and complex literary analysis of *The Mystery of Edwin Drood* by Charles Dickens. In terms of **fluency**, the writing is generally well-structured and grammatically correct, with a formal and academic tone. However, there are occasional issues with punctuation, missing words, and awkward phrasing (e.g., "somewhere" in a list of characters, "we may be sure that he was to see ‘that’ in real life" is slightly unclear). These minor issues do not severely hinder comprehension but suggest room for improvement.

Regarding **coherence**, the text is logically organized, with clear sections and a progression of ideas. The argument is well-developed, with supporting evidence and references to characters, theories, and illustrations. However, the dense and elaborate style, along with some repetitive points and tangents, can make the narrative feel convoluted at times. The text is more suited to a specialized audience familiar with Dickens and literary analysis, which may affect its accessibility.

Overall, the story is well-written and structured, but its complexity and occasional stylistic inconsistencies prevent it from achieving the highest fluency and coherence scores.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
