The story is written in a highly ornate and archaic style, which affects both fluency and coherence. In terms of fluency, the text contains numerous grammatical errors, misspellings (e.g., "thr earth," "tje antldiluvians," "dimentions"), and awkward phrasings that make it difficult to read smoothly. The use of archaic language and overly complex sentence structures further hinders fluency. Regarding coherence, the story presents a detailed and elaborate argument for a specific location being the Garden of Eden, but the flow of ideas is often disjointed and meandering. While the author attempts to connect biblical descriptions with geographical features, the narrative lacks a clear structure, and the logical progression is often obscured by excessive detail and tangents.
