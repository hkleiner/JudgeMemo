The story is written in a highly ornate and archaic style, with many complex sentences and elaborate descriptions. In terms of fluency, the text contains numerous grammatical errors, misspellings (e.g., "antldiluvians," "admirirg," "dimentions"), and awkward phrasings that hinder readability. The sentence structure is often convoluted, with long, run-on sentences that lack proper punctuation.

Regarding coherence, the text follows a general narrative structure as the author describes their discovery of what they believe to be the Garden of Eden. However, the flow is disrupted by frequent digressions, repetitive points, and a lack of clear organization. The author shifts between descriptive passages, historical references, and defensive arguments against critics, which makes the overall narrative feel disjointed.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
