The story is generally fluent, with well-constructed sentences and a literary tone that suits its biographical and historical content. However, there are occasional grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that disrupt the flow, such as "Bradley may Press started have he had the such mind idea n’t in it thank, some Wayside when did Godbut work" and "In bill wrapper of one a army to five game place--a the he dollar 'version old pretends.'" These issues affect fluency but are relatively infrequent. The text is coherent overall, with a clear narrative structure that moves chronologically through Will Bradley’s life and career. It connects ideas logically and maintains a consistent focus on his impact on American graphic arts. Some transitions between ideas could be smoother, but the story effectively builds a case for Bradley’s significance.
