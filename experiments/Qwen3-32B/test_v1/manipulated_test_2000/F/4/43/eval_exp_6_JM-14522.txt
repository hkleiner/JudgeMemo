The text is a well-known excerpt from *The Canterville Ghost* by Oscar Wilde, and it is generally well-written and coherent. The narrative flows logically, with clear character introductions, a consistent setting, and a gradual build-up of the ghostly events. However, there are a few problematic areas. A section of Washington Otis's speech is incoherent and appears to be corrupted or poorly written, which disrupts the fluency. Similarly, the chapter titled "CHAPTER: nothing" begins awkwardly and is not fully formed, affecting coherence. Despite these issues, the majority of the text is grammatically correct and well-structured, maintaining a strong narrative flow.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
