The text is a biographical narrative of Will Bradley, an influential figure in American graphic arts. It is generally well-written and informative, with a clear chronological structure in the second chapter. However, there are several issues affecting fluency, including numerous spelling and grammatical errors (e.g., "werenâ€™t" instead of "were not," "enriched" misspelled as "emriched," "thousands" misspelled as "thousands"). These errors disrupt the reading experience. In terms of coherence, the text is mostly organized and flows logically, especially in the second chapter, but some transitions between ideas could be smoother. The first chapter, while insightful, lacks a clear narrative thread and is more reflective and less structured than the second. Overall, the content is meaningful, but the fluency issues detract from the overall quality.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
