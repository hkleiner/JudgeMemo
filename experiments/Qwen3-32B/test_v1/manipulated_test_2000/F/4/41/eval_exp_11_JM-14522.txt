The text is an excerpt from "The Canterville Ghost" by Oscar Wilde, and it is generally well-written, but it contains several spelling and grammatical errors that affect fluency. Words like "seej," "afger," "finebfreedom," and "xnd" are incorrect and disrupt the reading experience. Additionally, some sentences are awkwardly phrased or contain punctuation issues. However, the overall story is coherent, with a clear narrative structure, logical progression of events, and a consistent tone that supports the genre of a gothic ghost story. The characters are introduced in a way that helps the reader follow the plot, and the setting is described effectively. Despite the fluency issues, the story remains understandable and engaging.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
