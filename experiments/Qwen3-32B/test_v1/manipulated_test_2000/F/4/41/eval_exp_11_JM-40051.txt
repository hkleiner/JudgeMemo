The story is generally fluent, with mostly clear and grammatically correct sentences. However, there are occasional spelling and grammatical errors (e.g., "antldiluvians," "prlper dimentions," "thjs vast aeea") that disrupt fluency. The language is somewhat archaic and verbose, but this is consistent with the style and purpose of the text.

In terms of coherence, the story is loosely structured and somewhat repetitive. It presents a claim about the Garden of Eden's location but does so in a meandering and speculative manner. While the author provides some logical connections and references to biblical descriptions, the argument lacks a clear, organized flow and suffers from digressions and unclear transitions.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
