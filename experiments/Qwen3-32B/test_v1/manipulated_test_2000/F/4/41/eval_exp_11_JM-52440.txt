The text is a theological treatise on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. In terms of **fluency**, the text is generally well-written with complex sentence structures and a formal tone, but it contains several typographical and grammatical errors (e.g., "establisjed," "unvommon," "admiestrated," "consecration produces no change in its quality or substance" followed by "The new birth is not in the water"). These errors occasionally disrupt the flow and readability. 

Regarding **coherence**, the text is logically structured and follows a clear argumentative path, with the author introducing the topic, defining key terms, and then examining doctrinal positions and supporting documents. However, some sections are dense and repetitive, and the argument could be clearer in places. Overall, the text maintains a coherent structure despite its length and complexity.
