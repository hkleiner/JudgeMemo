The text is a biographical narrative about the artist Will Bradley, written in a somewhat archaic and descriptive style. Regarding **fluency**, the writing contains numerous grammatical errors, inconsistent verb tenses, and awkward phrasing (e.g., “It shoulded be talked about,” “he may had had some such idea,” “you was on the ‘Narrow Gauge’”). These issues disrupt the readability and natural flow of the sentences. However, the overall meaning is generally clear. In terms of **coherence**, the narrative is well-structured, with a clear chronological progression and thematic focus on Bradley’s life and influence. The two chapters transition smoothly and maintain a consistent purpose, despite some stylistic inconsistencies.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
