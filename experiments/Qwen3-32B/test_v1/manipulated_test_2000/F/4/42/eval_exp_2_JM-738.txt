The text is generally fluent, with mostly well-formed sentences and a clear academic tone. However, there are some grammatical errors, such as incorrect verb tenses ("he certainly write no longer"), missing articles ("He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises"), and inconsistent capitalization ("roman policier"). These minor issues affect fluency slightly but do not impede overall readability. In terms of coherence, the text is well-structured, with a logical flow from introduction to analysis. It presents a clear argument about Dickensâ€™s last novel and its characters, and the narrative is consistent and focused. The structure supports the content effectively, though some transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. Overall, the text is coherent and readable, with only minor fluency issues.
