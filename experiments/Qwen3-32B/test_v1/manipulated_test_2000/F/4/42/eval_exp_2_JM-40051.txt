The text is written in a somewhat archaic and verbose style, which may be intentional given its religious and historical tone. In terms of **fluency**, the writing contains numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasings, and inconsistent verb tenses (e.g., “was locate,” “should was sought,” “must have been”). These issues disrupt the readability and make the prose feel less polished. However, the ideas are generally clear and the sentences, while flawed, are mostly understandable.

Regarding **coherence**, the text presents a logical narrative with a clear thesis: that a specific location in the United States matches the biblical description of the Garden of Eden. The author builds the argument by referencing geography, biblical passages, and local landmarks. Despite some tangents and repetition, the structure supports the central claim, and the flow of ideas is mostly consistent and purposeful.

**Final Evaluation:**

The text is coherent in its overall argument and structure, though the fluency is hindered by grammatical errors and awkward phrasing.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
