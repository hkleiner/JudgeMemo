The story is a well-known excerpt from *The Canterville Ghost* by Oscar Wilde, and it is generally fluent and coherent. Most sentences are grammatically correct and stylistically rich, with a clear narrative voice and appropriate vocabulary. However, there are a few grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that slightly affect fluency, such as "It must was removed at once" and "he have said these words." Despite these minor issues, the overall flow of the story is smooth and logical. The narrative is well-structured, with a clear progression of events and character interactions, making it easy to follow and understand. The coherence is strong, as the story builds logically from one scene to the next, maintaining a consistent tone and theme.
