The text is a formal theological treatise discussing the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. It is generally fluent, with mostly grammatically correct sentences and a consistent tone. However, there are occasional grammatical errors and awkward phrasings, such as "it would be found to consisted in nothing more" and "the point was supposed to had been settle," which slightly disrupt fluency. In terms of coherence, the text is well-structured and logically organized, with a clear progression from introduction to specific doctrinal points. The argument is methodical and consistent, making it easy to follow the author's reasoning. The ideas build upon one another, and the text maintains a clear focus on its central thesis.
