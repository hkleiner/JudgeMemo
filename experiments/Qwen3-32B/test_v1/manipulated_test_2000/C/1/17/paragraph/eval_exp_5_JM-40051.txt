The text is a mix of multiple, unrelated passages, which significantly affects both fluency and coherence. While individual sentences are generally well-written and grammatically correct, the story lacks a clear structure or logical progression. The content jumps between different narratives, such as the discovery of the Garden of Eden, a romantic and psychological drama involving Jasper and Rosa, and a Victorian-era house description, with no clear transitions or unifying theme. This disjointedness makes the text difficult to follow and diminishes its overall coherence. Fluency is relatively strong, though some minor errors and awkward phrasings are present.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
