The text exhibits a high level of fluency, with most sentences being well-written, grammatically correct, and stylistically complex. However, there are occasional inconsistencies in tone and register, such as the abrupt shift from theological discourse to a ghost story and then to a narrative about personal relationships, which disrupts the overall flow. In terms of coherence, the text is poorly structured and lacks a clear narrative or thematic unity. It transitions between unrelated chapters and topics—dialogue, theological debate, ghost story, and personal reflection—without logical connections or transitions. These shifts make it difficult to follow the intended message or purpose of the text as a whole.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
