The text is mostly fluent, with well-structured sentences and minimal grammatical errors. However, there are occasional awkward phrases and shifts in tone or perspective that slightly disrupt the flow. The coherence is mixed; while the first part of the text reads like a traditional ghost story and is logically organized, the second part introduces disjointed, unrelated narrative elements (e.g., reflections on Christmas and summer holidays) that do not align with the main plot. These deviations create confusion and weaken the overall coherence of the story.

FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
FINAL Fluency Score: 4
