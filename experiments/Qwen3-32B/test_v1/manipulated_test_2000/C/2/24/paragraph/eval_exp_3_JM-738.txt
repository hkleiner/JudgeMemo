The text is a scholarly analysis of Charles Dickens's novel *The Mystery of Edwin Drood*, written in a formal, academic tone. Regarding **fluency**, the sentences are generally well-constructed, with complex vocabulary and grammatically correct structure. However, some phrases are awkward or overly verbose, and the use of archaic or outdated language may hinder readability for modern readers. Regarding **coherence**, the text is logically organized, with clear sections and a consistent argument about Dickens's narrative construction and character analysis. However, the narrative occasionally shifts abruptly between analysis and plot summary, and some ideas are not fully explained, which slightly weakens the overall flow.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
