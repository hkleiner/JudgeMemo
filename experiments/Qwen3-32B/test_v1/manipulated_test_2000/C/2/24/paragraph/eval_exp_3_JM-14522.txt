The text is generally fluent, with well-written sentences and grammatically correct structures. The narrative flows smoothly, and the language is rich and descriptive, typical of a classic ghost story. However, there are a few minor inconsistencies and anachronistic elements (e.g., "A hologram displayed the weather" and "A bluetooth signal was detected") that disrupt the otherwise consistent 19th-century style and immersion. These modern insertions are likely errors and detract from the overall fluency.

In terms of coherence, the text is well-structured and organized, with a clear progression of events and character introductions. The story builds logically from the Otis family's arrival at Canterville Chase to the first encounter with the ghost. The narrative maintains a consistent tone and purpose, making it easy to follow and understand. Despite the anachronisms, the overall coherence remains strong due to the clear storytelling and logical flow.
