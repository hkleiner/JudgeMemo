The text is generally fluent, with well-structured sentences and proper grammar. The author uses formal, theological language consistently, and the sentences are clear and well-written, though occasionally complex. However, there are a few minor grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that slightly disrupt fluency, such as missing commas or inconsistent tenses. 

In terms of coherence, the text is highly organized and logically structured. It presents a clear argument, introduces key concepts, and follows a logical progression from introduction to analysis of the doctrine. The author defines terms, outlines positions, and refers to specific Church documents to support their claims. Despite the dense theological content, the ideas flow logically from one paragraph to the next, maintaining a strong sense of direction and purpose.
