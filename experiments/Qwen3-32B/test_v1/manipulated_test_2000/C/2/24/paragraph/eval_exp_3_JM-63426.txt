The text is generally fluent, with well-constructed sentences and mostly correct grammar. However, there are occasional awkward phrasings, missing words (e.g., “It is heated (?) with one stove”), and minor inconsistencies in tone or structure. These do not severely disrupt the reading experience but are noticeable.

In terms of coherence, the text is well-organized and follows a logical progression, especially in the first chapter, which sets up the historical and cultural context of Will Bradley’s work. The second chapter, a biographical narrative, is also coherent, though it occasionally shifts abruptly in tone or focus (e.g., the insertion of unrelated sentences like “The home assistant played ambient music” or “A livestream began recording”). These intrusions slightly disrupt the flow but do not entirely undermine the overall coherence.

FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
FINAL Fluency Score: 3
