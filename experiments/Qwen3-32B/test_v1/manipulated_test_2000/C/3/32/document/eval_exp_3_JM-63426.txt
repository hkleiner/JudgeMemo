The story is generally fluent, with well-constructed sentences and mostly correct grammar. However, there are occasional awkward phrasings and minor grammatical errors (e.g., missing articles, inconsistent verb tenses, and unclear pronoun references). The writing style is somewhat old-fashioned and occasionally verbose, which may affect readability for some readers.

In terms of coherence, the text is loosely structured and lacks a clear narrative flow. It jumps between different time periods and topics without smooth transitions, making it difficult to follow the progression of Will Bradley’s life and impact. The repetition of phrases like “a thing” and “a stuff” further disrupts the clarity and cohesion of the story.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
