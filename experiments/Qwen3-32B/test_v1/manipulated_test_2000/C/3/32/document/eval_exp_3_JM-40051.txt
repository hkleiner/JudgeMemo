The story is written in a highly enthusiastic and speculative tone, claiming to have discovered the Garden of Eden in the American Midwest. In terms of **fluency**, the text contains many grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and inconsistent punctuation (e.g., repeated use of “a stuff,” “the thing,” and unclear references). Some sentences are run-on or incomplete, and the language is often imprecise or overly verbose. However, the general meaning is usually discernible. In terms of **coherence**, the text lacks a clear structure. It jumps between ideas, introduces concepts without sufficient explanation, and often repeats points. While it attempts to present a logical argument for the location of Eden, the flow is disrupted by digressions and unclear transitions, making the overall argument hard to follow.

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
