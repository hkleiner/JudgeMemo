The text is a formal and theological treatise discussing the Church of England's doctrine on the Lord's Supper. Regarding **fluency**, the sentences are generally well-structured and grammatically correct, with a formal tone and complex vocabulary. However, some phrases are awkward or repetitive (e.g., "the stuff" and "a thing"), and there are occasional grammatical issues (e.g., missing articles or unclear pronoun references), which slightly hinder readability. Regarding **coherence**, the text is logically organized and builds a clear argument about the doctrine of the Real Presence. The structure follows an introduction, definitions, and analysis of doctrinal documents. However, the repetition of certain ideas and some unclear transitions between paragraphs slightly reduce the overall flow and clarity.
