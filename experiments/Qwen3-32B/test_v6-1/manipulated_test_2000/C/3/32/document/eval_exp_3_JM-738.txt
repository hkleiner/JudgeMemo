Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "a stuff" repeated multiple times without clarification  
- [GRAMMAR] "He is being watched by the hag, who hates him" – awkward phrasing  
- [LEXICON] "a thing" and "the thing" used repeatedly without context  
- [SYNTAX] "He is, presumably, acquainted with the languages of the eastern coast of a thing" – confusing and grammatically unclear  
- [GRAMMAR] "The tale opens abruptly with an opium-bred vision of the tower of Cloisterham Cathedral, beheld by Jasper as he awakens in the den of the Princess Puffer, between a Chinaman, a Lascar, and the hag herself" – overly complex and difficult to parse  
- [GRAMMAR] "He pronounces it 'unintelligible,' which satisfies him that his own babble, when under opium, must be unintelligible also" – redundant and awkward  
- [SPELLING] "Cathedral churchyard" – missing article (the)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He wears a soft slouched hat, and the pea-coat of the period" – awkward phrasing  
- [GRAMMAR] "You must output only and exactly the following format" – not relevant to the text being evaluated, but included in the text
