Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "a thing" repeated multiple times without clear meaning  
- [GRAMMAR] "You are put to work washing-up a Gordon press" (missing preposition or article)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The two jobbers are kicked" (unclear subject and verb agreement)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay of a lower-case beside the window" (awkward syntax)  
- [SPELLING] "He is standing in a market wagon and has a companion who strums a guitar and sings. Attached to an upright and above his head is a kerosene flare." (awkward phrasing and missing punctuation)  
- [SPELLING] "In winter it is heated (?) with one stove" (question mark indicates uncertainty or missing information)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The Peninsula Record, across the street, is a four-page tabloid. It is printed one page at a time on a large Gordon." (awkward and repetitive structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He offers you eight dollars a week. You are not that important to Mr. Newett--and the extra two dollars will enable you to begin saving..." (awkward transition and unclear logic)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "a thing" is used repeatedly in place of specific locations or objects, making the text confusing and fragmented  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different events and time periods without clear transitions  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "on the ‘Narrow Gauge’ on your way to a stuff" is unclear and lacks context  
- [LOGIC] The use of "the stuff" and "a thing" instead of specific names disrupts the logical flow of the narrative  
- [STRUCTURE] The introduction and the second chapter are written in a first-person narrative style, which is inconsistent with the overall tone of the text  
- [CLARITY] The text often uses vague or ambiguous language, such as "he sends you out to play" and "you are on the ‘Narrow Gauge’ on your way to a stuff," making it difficult to follow the story
