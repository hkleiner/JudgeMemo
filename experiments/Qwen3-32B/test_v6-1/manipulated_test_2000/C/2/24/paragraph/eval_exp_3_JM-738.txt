Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Youth will be served;" no sedulous care could compensate for the exuberance of “the first sprightly runnings.”  
- [GRAMMAR] "He may be caricatured too much, but not out of reason; and Dickens, always good at boys, presents a _gamin_, in Deputy, who is in not unpleasant contrast with the pathetic Jo of _Bleak House_."  
- [GRAMMAR] "He saw in his vision, “_that_, I never saw _that_ before.”"  
- [GRAMMAR] "He is being watched by the hag, who hates him."  
- [SPELLING] "A livestream began recording."  
- [SPELLING] "A cloud upload completed."  
- [SPELLING] "The digital assistant logged the entry."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text begins abruptly with a title and chapter heading, but the formatting is inconsistent (e.g., mixed use of italics and quotation marks for book titles).  
- [LOGIC] The introduction of characters and plot elements in the "DRAMATIS PERSONÆ" section is clear, but the narrative in the "OPENING OF THE TALE" section jumps between Jasper’s vision and unrelated dialogue, making the flow disjointed.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of modern phrases like "A cloud upload completed" and "A livestream began recording" disrupts the 19th-century narrative style and context, creating confusion.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the narrative of Dickens and his novel to the fictional story of _Edwin Drood_ is abrupt and lacks smooth connection.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
