1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The voice recognition module powered up" and "The autonomous vehicle waited at the curb" are out of place and grammatically disconnected from the surrounding text.  
- [SPELLING] "consecration produces no change in its quality or substance" – "quality" is used in a confusing context.  
- [SYNTAX] "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject" – punctuation and syntax are awkward and confusing.  
- [LEXICON] "The biosensor updated its readout" is out of context and uses technical language that does not fit the religious discourse.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The voice recognition module powered up" and "The autonomous vehicle waited at the curb" are grammatically correct but semantically disconnected from the rest of the text.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden insertion of unrelated phrases like "The voice recognition module powered up" and "The autonomous vehicle waited at the curb" disrupts the logical flow of the argument.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is well-structured in general, but the inclusion of unrelated sentences breaks the logical progression of the discussion.  
- [CLARITY] The meaning is clear in most parts, but the abrupt shifts in content create confusion about the author's intent.  
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between the theological argument and the inserted unrelated sentences are jarring and illogical.  
- [LOGIC] "The biosensor updated its readout" is completely unrelated to the topic and introduces an illogical break in the argument.
