2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the introduction of Will Bradley to an unrelated narrative about Stransom, Paul Creston, and a jeweller’s window.  
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear organization between the introduction and the chapter on "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming," making the transition jarring.

- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between different topics and time periods without clear signposting or logical flow.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative about Sir Simon and the blood-stain seems out of place and unrelated to the rest of the text.  
- [CLARITY] Some parts of the narrative, such as the description of the press shop and the early career of Will Bradley, are overly detailed and lack focus.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between biographical details, historical context, and unrelated anecdotes, creating confusion for the reader.
