Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises. He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character." (awkward phrasing and lack of parallel structure)  
- [SPELLING] "He had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion not unconnected with that range of feeling." (awkward phrasing and redundancy)  
- [SYNTAX] "Stransom had no sooner recognised him than the old woman turned away; but just with this growth of opportunity came a felt strangeness that stayed him in the very act of laying his hand on his friend’s arm." (cumbersome sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "We sang with gusto 'Christians awake, salute the happy morn.'" (use of "gusto" may be unclear in context)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Mr. Cuming Walters suggests that she is the mother of John Jasper, and, therefore, maternal grandmother of Edwin Drood." (awkward phrasing and unclear logic)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative abruptly shifts between analysis of Dickens’s writing and a fictionalized scene involving Stransom and Creston without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The introduction of the fictional scene involving Stransom and Creston is not clearly connected to the broader analysis of Dickens’s work.  
- [CLARITY] The text frequently uses complex and archaic phrasing that hinders clarity, such as "Youth will be served; no sedulous care could compensate for the exuberance of 'the first sprightly runnings.'"  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the analysis of Dickens’s construction of plots to the fictional scene is abrupt and confusing.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is a mix of literary analysis and narrative, making it difficult to discern the central focus or purpose.
