Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He laughed at my ready association of loss with money, and replied, ‘No, in talent and vigour.’" (awkward phrasing and incomplete thought)  
- [SYNTAX] "To them enter Durdles..." (passive voice and awkward structure)  
- [LEXICON] "he habitually sleeps off the fumes of liquor" (redundant and informal phrasing in an otherwise formal text)  
- [GRAMMAR] "This, then, is the object of this address" (awkward phrasing and unclear reference to "this address")  
- [GRAMMAR] "I am not about to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England" (awkward phrasing and missing preposition)  
- [GRAMMAR] "But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest possible divergence" (spelling of "connexion" is archaic and inconsistent with modern usage)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note occurred." (sudden shift in tone and content from the preceding theological text)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He accordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning it appeared again." (awkward phrasing and missing article)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs." (sentence is incomplete)  
- [GRAMMAR] "His precautions should have been those of a forger or a murderer" (awkward phrasing and unclear metaphor)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text abruptly shifts from a theological discussion to a ghost story and then to a narrative about George Stransom, with no clear connection or transition between the sections.  
- [LOGIC] The content appears to be a collection of disjointed excerpts from different texts, with no unified theme or narrative thread.  
- [TRANSITION] There is no logical progression or connection between the sections, making it difficult to determine the overall purpose or focus of the text.  
- [CLARITY] The text lacks a clear thesis or central argument, making it difficult to determine the author's intent.  
- [LOGIC] The theological discussion is detailed and structured, but the other sections are disconnected and do not contribute to the overall coherence of the text.
