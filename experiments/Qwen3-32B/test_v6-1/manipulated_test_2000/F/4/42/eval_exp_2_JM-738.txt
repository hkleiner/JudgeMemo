- [CLARITY] The author frequently uses vague or ambiguous language (e.g., "You must remember that, according to Forster...").  
- [TRANSITION] There is a lack of clear transitions between the introduction, analysis of characters, and the plot summary.  
- [LOGIC] The text introduces theories and counter-theories without clearly linking them to the central argument about Dickens's plot.  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of phrases like "He might had fallen into the follies of spiritualism" is unclear due to grammatical errors.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative abruptly shifts from biographical information about Dickens to the plot of *The Mystery of Edwin Drood* without clear guidance.  
- [LOGIC] Some sections appear to be summaries of other works (e.g., Lytton's tale) without clear relevance to the main argument.  
- [CLARITY] The author's personal opinions are interwoven with factual information without clear demarcation.  
- [LOGIC] The text occasionally digresses into unrelated details (e.g., the description of the illustration of Edwin) without explaining their significance.
