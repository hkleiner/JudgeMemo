- [LOGIC] The transition from the family's disbelief to their growing interest in the ghost is abrupt and unexplained.  
- [LOGIC] The introduction of American characters' reactions to the supernatural lacks a coherent connection to the British setting.  
- [LOGIC] The ghost's sudden anger and reaction to the American's offer to lubricate his chains is not clearly explained.  
- [LOGIC] The twins' involvement with the ghost is introduced abruptly and lacks a coherent setup.  
- [LOGIC] The ghost's appearance at the end of the chapter is not logically connected to the previous events in the corridor.
