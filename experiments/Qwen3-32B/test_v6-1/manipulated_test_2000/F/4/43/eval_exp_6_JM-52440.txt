- [SYNTAX] Awkward and fragmented sentence structure in multiple sections, particularly in the discussion of the Articles.  
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic or unclear phrasing that hinders readability, such as "It is not my business now to discuss the connexion between the visible sign and the invisible gift."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The argument occasionally shifts abruptly between theological concepts without clear transitions.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is dense and at times lacks clear paragraphing, making it difficult to follow the flow of ideas.  
- [CLARITY] Some sections are overly complex and use theological jargon without sufficient explanation for a general reader.  
- [TRANSITION] Poor transitions between sections and ideas, particularly in the discussion of the Articles and their implications.  
- [LOGIC] The text assumes prior knowledge of theological terms and doctrines without defining them, which can confuse readers unfamiliar with the subject matter.
