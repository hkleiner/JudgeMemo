2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The ghost's reappearance of the blood stain is not clearly explained, creating confusion about its nature and purpose.  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the Otis family's initial disbelief to their growing interest in the supernatural is abrupt and not well-motivated.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative shifts between detailed descriptions of the Otis family and the supernatural events without smooth transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The ghost's reaction to the American Minister's practical solution is confusing and lacks emotional or logical clarity.  
- [LOGIC] The twins' sudden appearance and attack on the ghost is unexplained and disrupts the narrative flow.  
- [STRUCTURE] The chapter ends with an unexpected and unresolved action (the pillow being thrown), leaving the reader without closure.
