Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors in "The twins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged two pellets on him" (should be "discharged two pellets at him").
- [GRAMMAR] Awkward phrasing in "I have no wish to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say that, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't think it is at all polite to throw pillows at him."
- [GRAMMAR] Awkward phrasing in "He had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in fact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means of it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord Canterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome Jack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to marry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and down the terrace at twilight."
- [GRAMMAR] Awkward phrasing in "The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September."
- [GRAMMAR] Awkward phrasing in "He was simply but neatly clad in a long shroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip of yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade."
- [GRAMMAR] Awkward phrasing in "He was a fair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself for American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for three successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an excellent dancer."
- [GRAMMAR] Awkward phrasing in "The only thing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he had not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences might have been very serious."
- [GRAMMAR] Awkward phrasing in "He had gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that there, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing himself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of the United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of the Canterville family pictures."
- [GRAMMAR] Awkward phrasing in "He was quite evidently a man of the most punctilious honour, and, though he had been somewhat taken aback by the American Minister's attitude, was determined to maintain the dignity of his family."
- [GRAMMAR] Awkward phrasing in "He was a fair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself for American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for three successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an excellent dancer."

2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] Inconsistent timeline in the description of the ghost's appearances and the family's reactions across chapters.
- [LOGIC] Confusing shift in perspective from third-person omniscient to first-person in some sections.
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent portrayal of the ghost's abilities and limitations (sometimes he can pass through walls, sometimes he cannot).
- [LOGIC] Confusing sequence of events in Chapter V where Virginia disappears and returns, with unclear motivations and consequences.
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent character motivations for the American family's interactions with the ghost.
- [LOGIC] Confusing transition from the ghost's attempts to frighten the family to his eventual defeat and death.
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent use of time references (e.g., "the 19th of September" without clear context).
- [LOGIC] Confusing portrayal of the ghost's death and resurrection (he appears dead but later seems to have supernatural abilities).
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent character development for Virginia, whose transformation from frightened child to brave savior is not fully explained.
- [LOGIC] Confusing resolution of the ghost's curse with the prophecy and the almond tree blooming.
