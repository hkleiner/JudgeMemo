1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He is not now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in the 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "But those who are loyal to the Church of England ought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching." (wordy and unclear)  
- [LEXICON] "And my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of her own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the assertion that she teaches what is commonly called ‘The Doctrine of the Real Presence.’" (repetition and verbose)  
- [GRAMMAR] "But, I believe, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at issue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and Sacrifice;" (awkward placement of "I believe")  
- [GRAMMAR] "It is not my business now to discuss the connexion between the visible sign and the invisible gift." (non-standard spelling of "connection")  
- [SPELLING] "connexion" (non-standard spelling)  
- [GRAMMAR] "But we are not left to depend altogether on such conclusions, for there is a special Article on the subject, viz., the twenty-eighth." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "But their conclusion is one which is such an outrage on common sense that it would be utterly ludicrous if it were not inexpressibly melancholy, to see men who, we hope, are devout men, embracing it." (long and convoluted)  
- [GRAMMAR] "But I am not surprised at his wish to draw attention from the Articles, but I am persuaded he will gain nothing by directing it to the Catechism." (awkward and repetitive structure)  
- [SPELLING] "connexion" (repeated non-standard spelling)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is highly dense and argumentative, with frequent shifts in tone and perspective that may confuse the reader.  
- [LOGIC] The argument is complex and often circular, with the author repeatedly asserting the same points without sufficient development or resolution.  
- [CLARITY] The distinction between the Church of England's doctrine and Roman Catholic teachings is not consistently clarified, leading to ambiguity.  
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between sections are abrupt and lack clear signposting, making it difficult to follow the logical progression of the argument.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text frequently digresses into historical anecdotes and polemical language, which can disrupt the main argument.  
- [LOGIC] The author often assumes the reader’s familiarity with theological concepts and historical context without explanation.  
- [CLARITY] The frequent use of archaic language and theological jargon may obscure the meaning for modern readers.  
- [LOGIC] Some arguments rely on emotional appeals rather than clear logical reasoning.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear summary or conclusion that ties together the various points made.  
- [CLARITY] The author sometimes uses the same terms in different ways without clarification, leading to potential confusion.
