Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "It is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such assertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful and best-established proof." – Awkward phrasing and redundancy.  
- [SPELLING] "the 6th chapter of St. John" – Missing article "the" before "6th chapter."  
- [SYNTAX] "I am not now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in the 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper." – Cumbersome and repetitive structure.  
- [LEXICON] "the Church of England is entering on such a sifting time as she has never yet experienced" – "sifting time" is archaic and unclear in modern usage.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject" – Dash usage is inconsistent and confusing.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between theological arguments and meta-commentary on the Church of England’s teachings without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The argument shifts from explaining the doctrine to defending the need to examine the Church’s teachings, which is not clearly connected to the main thesis.  
- [CLARITY] The distinction between "real presence" and "spiritual feeding" is not clearly defined early on, leading to potential confusion.  
- [TRANSITION] Sentences like "But no change is here described as taking place in the water" abruptly shift from discussing baptism to the general nature of sacraments without smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The author assumes the reader is already familiar with the doctrinal debates, which may hinder understanding for a general audience.
