Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing punctuation in some sentences (e.g., “He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises. He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character.”)  
- [SPELLING] Inconsistent use of italics and quotation marks (e.g., “_roman policier_” and “_Peveril_”)  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure (e.g., “We may think that the mannerisms of Mr. Honeythunder, the philanthropist, and of Miss Twinkleton, the schoolmistress, are not in the author’s best vein of humour.”)  
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic or obscure language that may be confusing (e.g., “hab nab at a venture,” “smacked of the apoplexy”)  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing or incorrect articles and prepositions (e.g., “We may think that the mannerisms of Mr. Honeythunder, the philanthropist, and of Miss Twinkleton, the schoolmistress, are not in the author’s best vein of humour.”)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Some logical inconsistencies in the flow of ideas (e.g., sudden shifts from analyzing Dickens’s characters to discussing critics and theories without clear transitions)  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed organization between paragraphs and sections (e.g., abrupt transition from the introduction to the dramatis personae)  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous or unclear references (e.g., “He saw in his vision, ‘_that_, I never saw _that_ before.’ We may be sure that he was to see ‘_that_’ in real life.” – unclear what “that” refers to)  
- [TRANSITION] Missing or weak transitions between paragraphs (e.g., moving from the story’s opening to Sapsea and Durdles without a clear connection)  
- [LOGIC] Repetition of ideas without progression (e.g., repeated emphasis on the “puzzle” of the plot without sufficient development)
