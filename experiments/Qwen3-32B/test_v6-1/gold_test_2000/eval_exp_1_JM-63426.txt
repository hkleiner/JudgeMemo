Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "You are the artist. Your mamma, with other mammas, is sitting on the platform, proud of her Willie--who is probably plenty proud of himself."  
- [GRAMMAR] Incomplete or fragmented sentence: "Your father is drawing cartoons for a Lynn daily--perhaps the Daily Item. He brings you a box of pi."  
- [LEXICON] Unusual or unclear phrasing: "There were derivative traces in Bradley’s early work--and whose hasn’t?"  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing punctuation or inconsistent capitalization: "The Peninsula Record, across the street, is a four-page tabloid. It is printed one page at a time on a large Gordon."  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward construction: "You are now on the 'Narrow Gauge' on your way to Boston."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in focus from Bradley’s professional achievements to a detailed, fictionalized childhood narrative with no clear connection to the main subject.  
- [STRUCTURE] The second chapter reads more like a fictionalized biography than a coherent continuation of the introduction.  
- [CLARITY] The narrative in "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" is overly descriptive and lacks clear thematic progression.  
- [TRANSITION] Poor transition between the first chapter, which is analytical and biographical, and the second, which reads like a fictionalized story.  
- [LOGIC] The second chapter does not clearly contribute to the reader’s understanding of Bradley’s impact on American graphic arts.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
