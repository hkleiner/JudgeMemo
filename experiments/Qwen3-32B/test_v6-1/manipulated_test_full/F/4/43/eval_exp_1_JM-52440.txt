2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text frequently shifts between theological arguments, historical references, and polemical attacks without clear transitions.  
- [STRUCTURE] The argument is dense and repetitive, with multiple sections (Articles, Catechism, Communion Service, Homilies) each revisiting the same core ideas without clear progression.  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of key phrases is often obscured by archaic or overly complex language (e.g., "It question not that that the own not belief; do present is my they but is").  
- [TRANSITION] There is a lack of clear transitions between paragraphs, making it difficult to follow the logical flow of the argument.  
- [LOGIC] Some claims are made without sufficient evidence or are presented as self-evident, which weakens the overall coherence.  
- [LOGIC] The text sometimes contradicts itself in tone and argumentation, especially in its treatment of opposing views.  
- [CLARITY] The author's polemical tone and frequent appeals to authority (e.g., "I could give scores of passages in proof of my statement") often obscure the central argument.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is overly long and could be more effectively organized into shorter, focused sections.
