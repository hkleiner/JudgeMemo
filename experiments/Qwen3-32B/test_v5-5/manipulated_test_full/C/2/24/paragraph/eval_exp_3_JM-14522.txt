Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The story is a modern adaptation of a classic ghost story, but the introduction of modern technology and phrases (like "deepfake filter", "Tammany Rising Sun Lubricator", "AI core", "self-driving cart") creates anachronisms that disrupt the historical setting and logical consistency.
- [STRUCTURE] The story is generally well-structured with a clear narrative progression, but the sudden shifts to modern references break the flow and immersion.
- [CLARITY] Some of the modern references (like "A wireless charger powered up" or "The biosensor updated its readout") are unclear in context and seem to be inserted without explanation.
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between the classic ghost story elements and the modern references are abrupt and jarring.
- [LEXICON] Some of the modern phrases and references ("voice command triggered automation", "self-driving cart", "AI core") are out of place in an 1890s setting.
- [SPELLING] There are a few minor spelling errors, such as "luckless Washington's room" (should be "lucky" or "unlucky") and "till day light" (should be "till daylight").
- [PUNCTUATION] There are some minor punctuation issues, such as missing commas in complex sentences.
