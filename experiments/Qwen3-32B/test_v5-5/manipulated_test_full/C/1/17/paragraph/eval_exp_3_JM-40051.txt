Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The story lacks a clear narrative structure, jumping between descriptions of the landscape, theological arguments, and random unrelated anecdotes (e.g., Jasper from Dickens, a landlord at "Dog and Measles," and a commercial traveler).  
- [LOGIC] The argument for the Garden of Eden being in Wisconsin is inconsistent and lacks logical progression. The author introduces new claims without connecting them to the previous ones.  
- [CLARITY] The writing is often vague or overly complex, making it difficult to follow the author's reasoning (e.g., "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the 'North West,' as the place").  
- [TRANSITION] There are no smooth transitions between paragraphs or ideas; the text shifts abruptly from one topic to another.  
- [SPELLING] Several spelling errors are present (e.g., "antldiluvians," "admirirg," "dimentions," "antediluvian," "inhabitant," "euphony," "ampitheater," "jageed," "beatiful," "beau ideal," "Philedelphia").  
- [GRAMMAR] Numerous grammatical errors, including missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and run-on sentences (e.g., "But by degrees it has been opening to the minds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere on the American Continent").  
- [SYNTAX] The sentence structures are often awkward or overly long, which hinders readability (e.g., "As everything in creation was full and perfect, God wisely placed the earth in the summer solstice point of its orbit, and this continent facing the sun, so that when he placed man upon it, as to give him the benefit of harvest, and correct time, and all of which is proved by the change, God ordered, from original reckoning of time, when Israel left Egypt").  
- [LEXICON] Some word choices are unclear or misused (e.g., "beau ideal," "ampitheater," "purgatory," "facsimile").  
- [COHERENCE] The story is disjointed and lacks a cohesive theme. It reads more like a collection of loosely related observations and claims rather than a unified argument.  
- [REPETITION] The phrase "Come and see!" is repeated excessively, reducing the impact of the message.
