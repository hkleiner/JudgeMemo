Issues: 
[COHERENCE] The story has an overall coherent structure as it follows the life of Will Bradley chronologically, but there are some abrupt shifts in perspective and time that could be confusing. For example, the story moves from Bradley's childhood to his career without clear transitions.
[COHERENCE] Some paragraphs begin with "You" (presumably the reader) being in a situation, which is jarring as it shifts from third-person narrative to second-person without explanation.
[COHERENCE] There are occasional digressions, such as the section about Millet that seems out of place in the narrative about Bradley's early life.
[COHERENCE] The story sometimes jumps between different time periods without clear markers, making it difficult to follow the chronology.
[COHERENCE] The final chapter "Today in 1954" and "An Afterword" feel somewhat disconnected from the main narrative flow.
[COHERENCE] The story includes some historical and literary references that are not clearly connected to Bradley's personal story.
[FLUENCY] There are some minor grammatical issues and awkward phrasings that slightly disrupt the flow. For example, "The children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at the doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of the settlement." is a bit convoluted.
[FLUENCY] Some sentences are overly long and complex, making them difficult to follow. For example, "The prophets were not confined to the kingdom of Israel, or to any one kingdom, nor yet to any one dispensation."
[FLUENCY] There are a few instances of inconsistent verb tense usage that slightly affect the smoothness of the text.
[FLUENCY] Some phrases are anachronistic or use outdated expressions that might be confusing to modern readers.
[FLUENCY] There are a few punctuation issues, such as missing commas in complex sentences that could benefit from them for clarity.
