- [LOGIC] There are occasional shifts in time and narrative perspective that could be more clearly signaled to maintain coherence.
- [SPELLING] There are a few spelling errors such as "wason't" instead of "wasn't" and "itâ€™s" missing an apostrophe in some places.
- [GRAMMAR] There are several grammatical errors including incorrect verb tenses ("he may had had"), subject-verb agreement issues, and missing articles.
- [PUNCTUATION] Some sentences lack proper punctuation or have inconsistent punctuation usage.
