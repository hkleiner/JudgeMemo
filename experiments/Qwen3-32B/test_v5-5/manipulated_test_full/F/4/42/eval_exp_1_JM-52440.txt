Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] There are multiple grammatical errors throughout the text, such as "In did this, our first business is to ascertain..." (should be "In doing this"), "we was taught by our Lord Himself" (should be "we were taught"), and "we was one bread and one body" (should be "we were one bread and one body").
- [SPELLING] There are several misspelled words such as "was" instead of "were", "was" instead of "is", and "was" instead of "have been".
- [SYNTAX] The text contains awkward or incorrect sentence structures that make the meaning unclear or confusing, such as "I am not now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in the 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of the Lordâ€™s Supper."
- [LOGIC] Some parts of the text are logically inconsistent or confusing, particularly in the theological arguments presented. For example, the text attempts to reconcile contradictory interpretations of Church of England doctrine.
- [STRUCTURE] The structure of the text is complex and dense, with long paragraphs and little variation in sentence structure, making it difficult to follow the argument flow.
- [CLARITY] The text often uses archaic language and complex theological terminology without sufficient explanation, making it difficult for modern readers to understand the arguments being made.
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between ideas and sections are often abrupt, with little to connect one paragraph to the next or to show the logical progression of the argument.
