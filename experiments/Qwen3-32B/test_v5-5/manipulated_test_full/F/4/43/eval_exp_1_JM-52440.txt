Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Several grammatical errors are present, such as "It question not that that the own not belief; do present is my they but is." and "If a man . . . by blood do the doth and believe our Saviour and of do Sacrament for, benefits soul doth not not he the steadfastly Cross the the death eat health of, he himself redemption profitably ’s his receive repent he receive and he if sins, curate thereby for his his the him, remembering ’s mouth that body Christ hearty, to suffer." These sentences are grammatically incorrect and difficult to parse.  
- [SPELLING] There are numerous spelling errors, such as "dear old Church is at this present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the most earnest prayers of all those who love the truth." This sentence is grammatically correct but the surrounding text contains errors.  
- [SYNTAX] The syntax is often convoluted and hard to follow, such as in the sentence: "If a man . . . by blood do the doth and believe our Saviour and of do Sacrament for, benefits soul doth not not he the steadfastly Cross the the death eat health of, he himself redemption profitably ’s his receive repent he receive and he if sins, curate thereby for his his the him, remembering ’s mouth that body Christ hearty, to suffer."  
- [LEXICON] Some word choices are unclear or ambiguous, such as "The means whereby the body feeds is the same as in common eating, and the means on which the soul feeds is faith." The use of "means" is ambiguous and could be clearer.  
- [LOGIC] There are logical inconsistencies and abrupt shifts in reasoning, such as in the discussion of the Catechism and the Articles, where the author moves from one point to another without clear transitions.  
- [STRUCTURE] The structure of the text is complex and at times confusing, with long paragraphs and multiple subpoints that are not clearly separated or labeled.  
- [CLARITY] Some passages are unclear or ambiguous, such as "It is headed with the words, ‘Of the wicked which eat not the body of Christ.’" The sentence structure is confusing and the meaning is not immediately clear.  
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs and sections are often abrupt, making it difficult to follow the author's line of reasoning. For example, the transition from the discussion of the Articles to the Catechism is not smooth.
