Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The story is written in a scholarly, analytical tone rather than a narrative one, making it feel more like a literary essay than a story.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative is fragmented and lacks a clear progression of events, as it reads more like a critical analysis than a plot-driven story.  
- [CLARITY] The text contains complex and archaic language that may confuse modern readers and obscures the narrative.  
- [TRANSITION] There is a lack of smooth transitions between sections, especially between the introduction and the dramatis personae.  
- [SPELLING] Some words are inconsistently capitalized or hyphenated (e.g., “roman policier” vs. “_roman policier_”).  
- [LEXICON] The use of archaic and overly formal vocabulary hinders readability and immersion.  
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, making them difficult to follow.
