Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The blood-stain has been much admired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed." – Awkward phrasing.  
- [SPELLING] "sanguineous" – Though correct, it is overly complex and may be a minor distraction.  
- [LOGIC] The reappearance of the blood stain is not clearly explained in a way that connects with the prior events, creating some confusion.  
- [CLARITY] "The conversation in no way turned upon ghosts..." – Slightly unclear phrasing.  
- [STRUCTURE] The story is well-structured and flows logically, with a clear progression from chapter to chapter.  
- [TRANSITION] Smooth transitions between paragraphs and chapters.  
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or overly formal expressions may be slightly jarring to modern readers (e.g., "phial," "guilty spirit").  
- [SYNTAX] Generally well-constructed sentences, though a few are overly long and complex.
