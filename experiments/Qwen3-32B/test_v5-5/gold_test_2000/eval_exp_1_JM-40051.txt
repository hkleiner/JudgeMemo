Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Several grammatical errors, such as "have a reasonable thing of it," "have ventured to publish it," "as the plat, to me then, was altogether too large," "and admirirg its most wonderful scenery," "but of this last fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden," and "as I have discovered them."  
- [SPELLING] Spelling errors like "antldiluvians," "dimentions," "scientest," "Jordon," "Bridtish," "jageed," and "antideluvians."  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward and overly complex sentence structures, such as "In giving the antldiluvians a description of the creation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and how God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts..."  
- [LEXICON] Misuse or incorrect word choice, such as "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the 'North West'," "the fabled dog, 'they grabbed for the shadow and lost the reality,'" and "the 'Face of a King.'"  
- [LOGIC] Logical inconsistencies and unclear reasoning, such as the author's claim to have found the Garden of Eden in a specific geographic location without sufficient evidence or logical support.  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed and repetitive structure; the text jumps between narrative and argumentation without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] Lack of clarity in many passages, such as "the 'Father of Waters,' which means long river, symbol of greatness and importance," and "the fabled dog, 'they grabbed for the shadow and lost the reality.'"  
- [TRANSITION] Poor transitions between paragraphs and ideas, making the narrative feel fragmented and disorganized.
