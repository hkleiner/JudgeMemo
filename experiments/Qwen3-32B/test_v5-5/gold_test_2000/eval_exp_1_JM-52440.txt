Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The story is written in a very formal and dense academic style, which may hinder readability for some audiences. The structure is logical and well-organized, but the length and complexity of sentences make it difficult to follow at times.  
- [LEXICON] The use of archaic and theological vocabulary may obscure meaning for readers unfamiliar with the subject matter.  
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and contain multiple clauses, which can disrupt the flow and clarity of the text.  
- [CLARITY] The argument is clear in its intent, but the dense phrasing and complex structure reduce the overall clarity of the message.  
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs are generally smooth, but the shift from introduction to detailed theological analysis is abrupt and could benefit from a smoother introduction.
