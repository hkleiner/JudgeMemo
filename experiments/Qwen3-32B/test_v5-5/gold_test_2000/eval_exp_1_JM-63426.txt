Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Sentence fragments and missing subjects in some sentences, e.g., "It is graduation day... Miss Parrot is the teacher--a dear!"  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb agreement: "The employees are all natives--Universalists and Unitarians, probably."  
- [SPELLING] "pi" instead of "ink" in "When you succeed in finding a few letters of the same font you file them to fit the type slot in the press. Your father is ill, an aftermath of the Civil War. You have moved to the section called Swampscott. This is too far away for you to attend the school to which your class has gone."  
- [SPELLING] "Narrow Gauge" and "picklelime" appear without context, possibly archaic but could confuse modern readers.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different time periods and events without clear transitions, e.g., from childhood to adult life in Ishpeming.  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous or unclear references, such as "He gives you much fine advice which you never forget" – it is unclear what the advice was.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs, especially between the introduction and the biographical section.  
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or obscure vocabulary (e.g., "devil" for printer's apprentice) may be confusing without context.  
- [GRAMMAR] Run-on sentences and missing punctuation: "The editor’s sanctum is at the front. His desk is at the big window. It is nearly nine o’clock on a Friday night--“make-up” time. Mr. Newett has written his last sheets of copy and is reading proof."  
- [LOGIC] The story ends abruptly with Mr. Newett walking to a corner with guns and fishing rods, leaving the narrative incomplete or unresolved.
