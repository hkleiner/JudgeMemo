Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Multiple grammatical errors in the text, particularly in the middle of the story where it says "I it at short ghost money that, as public time thing there we and or; have in I if all in can..." This is incoherent and grammatically incorrect.
- [SPELLING] Some misspelled words or unusual word choices, such as "beenn-has" and "phantasmata."
- [SYNTAX] The sentence structure is often awkward or incorrect, especially in the passage "This former the was, Umney 's, in to Mrs., consented Mrs. herLady housekeeper whom, earnest request keep Canterville at Otis had position."
- [LOGIC] Some parts of the story do not follow logically, such as the sudden appearance of the ghost and the lack of explanation for its return.
- [STRUCTURE] The story is missing a proper chapter heading in "CHAPTER: nothing" and the narrative flow is disrupted by this inconsistency.
- [CLARITY] The text is not always clear, particularly in the section where Washington Otis speaks about Pinkerton's Champion Stain Remover and Paragon Detergent, which is not explained or connected to the main plot in a coherent way.
- [TRANSITION] There are abrupt transitions between some parts of the story, such as from the discussion of the bloodstain to the description of the ghost's appearance.
- [LEXICON] Some word choices are either incorrect or inappropriate for the context, making the text harder to understand.
