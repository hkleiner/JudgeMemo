Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors, such as "It has appeared in brief articles... and criticism" (missing verb).  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing articles or prepositions, e.g., "He, evidently, must place him somewhere."  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb tense usage, e.g., "have ventured to publish it" (should be "have ventured to publish it" is correct, but inconsistent usage elsewhere).  
- [SPELLING] Misspelled words: "antldiluvians", "admirirg", "dimentions", "scientest", "Jordon", "consitutes", "hightest", "jageed".  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward and run-on sentences, e.g., "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere."  
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent logic in reasoning; the argument for Eden being in the American Midwest is not clearly supported or logically developed.  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed paragraphs; the narrative jumps between descriptive details and assertions without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references and unclear pronouns, e.g., "he" in "he could not point it out to them" is unclear.  
- [TRANSITION] Poor transitions between ideas, especially between the introduction, the historical argument, and the geographical description.  
- [LEXICON] Inappropriate or archaic word choices, e.g., "antideluvians", "plat", "hanging garden", used in a confusing or unclear manner.  
- [COHERENCE] Lack of a clear narrative arc; the text reads like a collection of loosely connected observations rather than a unified argument.
