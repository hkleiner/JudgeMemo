Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple spelling errors throughout the text (e.g., "vommon," "confidenve," "doctrime," "groundnwork," "srrvice," "blessed," "prssent," "vize," "consecration," "incorpoeated," "tbing," "hexven," "tye," "dign").
- [GRAMMAR] Several grammatical errors, including incorrect verb forms, missing articles, and incorrect prepositions (e.g., "IR is a very easy thing," "as ifmthey," "the real groundworknof," "bascially," "tue three principal points," "investigatemin").
- [SYNTAX] Awkward and sometimes confusing sentence structures (e.g., "It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not the present question. My prssent concern is with the fact that, however we explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a feeding is essential to our life").
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic or obscure language that may hinder readability for modern readers (e.g., "κοινωνία", "blessed Saviour", "Daviour").
- [CLARITY] Some parts are unclear or ambiguous due to word choice or phrasing (e.g., "It is not my business now to discuss the connexion between the visible sign and the invisible gift").
- [STRUCTURE] While the text is logically organized into chapters and sections, the dense and repetitive nature of the argument can make it feel disjointed at times.
- [TRANSITION] Some transitions between paragraphs and ideas are abrupt or lack smooth connection (e.g., sudden shifts in focus between doctrinal definitions and broader implications).
