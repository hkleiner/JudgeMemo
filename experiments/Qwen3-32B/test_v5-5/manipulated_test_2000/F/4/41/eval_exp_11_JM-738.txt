Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Multiple misspellings such as “assiduously cultivated” (correct), “absolutsly” (should be “absolutely”), “deserfed” (should be “deserted”), “ajd” (should be “and”), “romam policier” (should be “roman policier”), “apopldxy” (should be “apoplexy”), “seuzures” (should be “seizures”), “oeft” (should be “left”), “atmosphers” (should be “atmosphere”), “x lack” (should be “a lack”), “kpium den” (should be “opium den”), “conceaoed” (should be “concealed”), “bthe supernatural” (should be “the supernatural”), “there arectwo specimens” (should be “there are two specimens”), “thickmblack whiskers” (should be “thick black whiskers”), “ovwr” (should be “over”), “nickjamed” (should be “nicknamed”), “yexrs” (should be “years”), “bafkre” (should be “before”), “fhat” (should be “that”), “Fathedral” (should be “Cathedral”), “pronouhces” (should be “pronounces”), “muzt” (should be “must”), “unintelligiboe” (should be “unintelligible”), “svholar” (should be “scholar”), “giod” (should be “good”), “betrothed” (should be “betrothed”), “illustfation” (should be “illustration”), “Durdpes” (should be “Durdles”).  
- [GRAMMAR] Several grammatical errors such as missing articles (“a very curious and new idea”), incorrect prepositions (“he was working over the late Lord Lytton’s tale for _All The Year Round_”), incorrect verb tenses or agreement (“he succeeded to his father’s share in an engineering firm”), and awkward phrasing (“he spoke to his sister-in-law, Miss Hogarth, about his fear that he had not sufficiently concealed his tracks in the latest numbers”).  
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or unclear word usage (“hab nab at a venture,” “smacked of the apoplexy,” “gamin,” “Billickin,” “romam policier”) that may confuse modern readers without context.  
- [STRUCTURE] The story is structured as an academic or critical essay rather than a narrative, which may hinder its coherence as a story. The introduction is more analytical than narrative, and the characters and plot are presented in a detached, summary-like manner.  
- [CLARITY] Some parts are unclear due to overly complex or elliptical sentences, such as “He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _romam policier_, careful study of character.”  
- [TRANSITION] Some abrupt shifts between ideas and sections, particularly between the critical analysis in the introduction and the narrative section.
