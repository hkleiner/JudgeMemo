Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Multiple spelling errors throughout the text (e.g., "antldiluvians", "princopak", "locayion", "thr", "thr", "prlper dimentions", "investigatikn", "ingenuoty", "Havilah", "Bridtish", "thjs", "euphony", "innabited", "throughmwhich", "sloughs", "hightest", "dor", "scwttered", "jt", "rattlesnake hills", "separate andcdistinct", "Ligerally", "rodz", "gardrn", "endkess", "wagged").  
- [GRAMMAR] Numerous grammatical errors including missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and awkward phrasing (e.g., "have ventured to publish it", "He, evidently, must place him somewhere", "It should be destitute of money mineral wealth", "It is located on the 'eastward bank' of the Mississippi River, between the beautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota", "We need not now undertake to orove").  
- [SYNTAX] Sentence structure is often convoluted or incomplete (e.g., "And from thence,——it was which means long river", "But of this last fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and commenced developing the facts about it").  
- [LOGIC] The narrative is filled with unsupported claims and logical inconsistencies (e.g., the claim that Eden is located in a specific region of the United States based on tenuous interpretations of biblical text, and the assertion that this location fits the description of Eden better than any other).  
- [CLARITY] The text is often unclear and difficult to follow due to overly complex sentences, lack of logical flow, and vague references (e.g., "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as thr 'North West'").  
- [TRANSITION] The story lacks smooth transitions between ideas and paragraphs, leading to a disjointed reading experience (e.g., abrupt shifts from the author's personal reflections to descriptions of geography and back again).  
- [LEXICON] The use of archaic or overly formal language alongside modern speech creates inconsistency and confusion (e.g., "He, evidently, must place him somewhere" followed by "but of this last fact I was ignorant").  
- [STRUCTURE] The overall structure of the text is disorganized, with sections that seem to repeat or overlap without clear progression or purpose (e.g., the article appears to be written in parts or sections that are not clearly demarcated or connected).  
- [PUNCTUATION] Misuse or absence of punctuation, including excessive dashes, missing commas, and inconsistent use of quotation marks and em dashes (e.g., "——it was which means long river", "And from thence,——it was which means long river", "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as thr 'North West', as the place").
