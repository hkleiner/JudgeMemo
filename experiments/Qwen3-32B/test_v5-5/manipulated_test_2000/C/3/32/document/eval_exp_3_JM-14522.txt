Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Repeated use of "a thing" and "a stuff" as placeholders, which are grammatically incorrect and disrupt the flow.  
- [SPELLING] "waggonette" is spelled inconsistently with modern spelling norms (correct spelling is "wagonette").  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in phrases like "I have come from a modern country, where we have everything that money can buy," which is grammatically correct but stylistically clunky.  
- [LEXICON] Inconsistent and inappropriate word choices, such as "the thing" and "a stuff," which appear to be fillers or placeholders and do not contribute to the narrative.  
- [LOGIC] The story introduces characters and events in a generally logical sequence, but the repeated appearance of the blood stain is not fully explained in a coherent way.  
- [STRUCTURE] The story is divided into chapters and follows a clear narrative arc, but the placeholder words disrupt the structure and make parts of the text feel incomplete.  
- [CLARITY] The use of "a thing" and "a stuff" reduces clarity and makes the text difficult to follow in places.  
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs are mostly smooth, but the abrupt shifts in tone and the use of placeholder words create some jarring effects.
