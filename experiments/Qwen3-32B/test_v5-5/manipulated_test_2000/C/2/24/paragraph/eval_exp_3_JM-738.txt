Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The story is written in a formal, academic tone with dense and complex sentences, making it feel more like a critical essay than a narrative, which may confuse the reader expecting a more traditional story.  
- [LOGIC] Some parts of the text, such as the introduction and the analysis of characters, lack a clear progression of ideas and feel more like scholarly commentary than storytelling.  
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between the introduction, character analysis, and the actual story are abrupt and lack smooth flow.  
- [CLARITY] Certain phrases are ambiguous or overly complex, such as “He saw in his vision, ‘_that_, I never saw _that_ before.’ We may be sure that he was to see ‘_that_’ in real life,” which is confusing without further explanation.  
- [SPELLING] There are occasional spelling errors or typographical issues, such as “A cloud upload completed” and “A livestream began recording,” which appear to be out-of-place and disruptive.  
- [SYNTAX] The syntax in many sentences is overly complex and occasionally awkward, which can hinder readability, for example: “He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises. He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character.”  
- [LEXICON] The use of archaic or overly formal vocabulary and sentence structures can make the text feel inaccessible to modern readers.  
- [COHERENCE] The story portion is disjointed and lacks a clear narrative arc, especially in the middle section where the characters are introduced without a strong sense of plot development.  
- [CONTEXT] The story is incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence, which disrupts the overall narrative flow and leaves the reader hanging.
