Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "sanguineous" is misspelled as "sanguineous" (correct spelling is "sanguineous").
- [LEXICON] "phantasmata" is an archaic or overly complex word choice for general readability.
- [SPELLING] "receptive expectations" is awkward phrasing and not commonly used in standard English.
- [LOGIC] The mention of a "hologram displayed the weather" and "a bluetooth signal was detected" is out of place and disrupts the narrative logic and historical setting of the story.
- [LOGIC] The line "A surveillance camera moved slightly" is anachronistic and disrupts the story's 19th-century setting.
- [STRUCTURE] The story is well-structured overall, but the anachronistic elements disrupt the flow and immersion.
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs are mostly smooth, but the anachronisms create jarring shifts in tone and time period.
