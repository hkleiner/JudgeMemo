Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The story jumps between different narratives and time periods without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the main plot of *The Canterville Ghost*.  
- [LOGIC] The inclusion of unrelated passages about Dickens and Edwin Drood disrupts the logical flow and coherence of the main narrative.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "Stransom" and "Mary Antrim" is confusing and not clearly connected to the main story, causing ambiguity.  
- [LOGIC] The shift to a Christmas Day reflection and comparison with summer holidays is irrelevant to the main plot and feels inserted without purpose.  
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between chapters and sections are abrupt and lack smooth narrative flow.  
- [SPELLING] Minor spelling errors, such as "phantasmata" and "Sanguineous," while not incorrect, are overly complex and may hinder readability.  
- [LEXICON] Some word choices are overly formal or archaic (e.g., "phial," "gyves"), which may feel inconsistent with the overall tone.  
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and complex, making them difficult to parse (e.g., the Christmas Day paragraph).  

FINAL Coherence Score: 3
