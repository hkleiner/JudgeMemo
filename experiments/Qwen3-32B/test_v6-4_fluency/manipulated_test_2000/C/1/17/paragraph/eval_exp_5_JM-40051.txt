1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing articles and prepositions (e.g., "have a reasonable thing of it," "the Euphrates river crosses that country, that ‘eastward’").  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "have ventured to publish it," "the names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations of facts well known to the antideluvians").  
- [SPELLING] Misspelled words (e.g., "antldiluvians," "dimentions," "admirirg," "Bridtish," "consitutes").  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward or run-on sentences (e.g., "When God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must place him somewhere").  
- [SYNTAX] Illogical or unclear phrasing (e.g., "It is located on the ‘eastward bank’ of the Mississippi River, between the beautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota").  
- [LEXICON] Inconsistent or unclear word choice (e.g., "the ‘Father of Waters’" used ambiguously, "the ‘bloom is off the plum’ of their prearranged loves").  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or incorrect punctuation (e.g., missing commas, improper use of em dashes, missing quotation marks).  
- [COHESION] Sudden shifts in topic or tone (e.g., from religious speculation to unrelated plot about Jasper and Rosa, then to a housekeeper in a library).  
- [COHESION] Repetition and redundancy (e.g., repeated emphasis on the Mississippi River as the Euphrates, repeated descriptions of the garden).  
- [COHESION] Lack of clear transitions between paragraphs and ideas.
