1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "He had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion not unconnected with that range of feeling."

- [SYNTAX] Unclear phrasing in "He coloured as well as smiled in the strong light of the shop when Stransom raised a tentative hat to the lady."

- [SYNTAX] Confusing sentence structure in "He must remember that, according to Forster, 'such was Dickens’s interest in things supernatural that, but for the strong restraining power of his common sense, he might have fallen into the follies of spiritualism.'"  
- [SPELLING] "ravaged mask bent over the open grave by which they had stood together." (awkward phrasing, not spelling per se, but affects fluency)

- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "If I am right, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material premonitions of 'The Signalman' in Mugby Junction."  
- [GRAMMAR] Misuse of quotation marks and lack of clarity in "He saw in his vision, 'that,' I never saw 'that' before."  
- [SYNTAX] Confusing sentence structure in "Mr. Cuming Walters suggests that she is the mother of John Jasper, and, therefore, maternal grandmother of Edwin Drood."  
- [GRAMMAR] Misplaced modifier in "She detests her client, Jasper, and plays the spy on his movements, for reasons unexplained."

- [GRAMMAR] Misuse of "The most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin..."
