Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "The story is rich in secrets and surprises" should be "The stories are rich...")
- [GRAMMAR] Misuse of articles (e.g., "He constructed elaborate plots" should be "He constructed an elaborate plot")
- [GRAMMAR] Sentence fragments (e.g., "But Dickensâ€™s new story of _The Mystery of Edwin Drood_" lacks a complete thought)
- [SPELLING] Inconsistent capitalization of "The" in titles (e.g., "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" vs. "the Mystery of Edwin Drood")
- [GRAMMAR] Misplaced modifiers (e.g., "He may be caricatured too much, but not out of reason" is awkwardly phrased)
- [GRAMMAR] Run-on sentences (e.g., long sentences with multiple clauses without proper punctuation)
- [GRAMMAR] Confusing use of "a thing" and "the thing" which appears frequently and disrupts readability
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent use of tenses (e.g., "He had a friend Mr. Drood" vs. "Mr. Bud wedded a lady")
- [GRAMMAR] Missing prepositions (e.g., "He took this drug both in his lodgings" should be "He took this drug both in his lodgings over...")
- [GRAMMAR] Awkward phrasing of conditional statements (e.g., "If I am right, Dickens went further" is unclear)
