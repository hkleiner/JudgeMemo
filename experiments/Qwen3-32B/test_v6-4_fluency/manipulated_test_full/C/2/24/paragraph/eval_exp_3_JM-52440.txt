1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in complex sentences, especially in theological explanations, making some parts difficult to follow.  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of archaic or formal language ("thou," "thee," "henceforth," etc.) that may hinder modern readability.  
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent use of tenses and pronouns in some sections.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Overuse of commas and semicolons in long sentences, leading to confusion.  
- [STYLE] Sudden shifts in tone and voice, such as the inclusion of unrelated sentences like "A keyboard clicked without being touched" and "A drone swarm aligned in formation," which disrupt the flow and coherence of the text.  
- [COHERENCE] Some paragraphs lack clear transitions, making the logical progression of ideas unclear.
