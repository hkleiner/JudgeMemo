-> 1) Issues:  
[GRAMMAR] - Multiple grammatical errors (e.g., "ans place reliance", "vlindly", "experiejced", "het that", "Docteine", "iur", "ak", "whsther", "yhat", "wind", "so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine, although they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ Himself").  
[SPLELLING] - Several spelling mistakes (e.g., "vlindly", "experiejced", "het", "Docteine", "iur", "ak", "whsther", "yhat", "wind", "cse", "certain", "closely", "certain", "closely", "certain", "closely", "certain", "closely", "certain", "closely").  
[SYNTAX] - Awkward sentence structures and run-on sentences (e.g., "The Scriptures are not investigated because the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the documents of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded as beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that opinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than confident assertion").  
[LEXICON] - Inconsistent or incorrect word usage (e.g., "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject").  
[STRUCTURE] - The text is overly long and dense, making it difficult to follow the argument without frequent re-reading.  
[CLARITY] - The argument is often obscured by complex and verbose language, reducing clarity.  
[TRANSITION] - Transitions between ideas and paragraphs are sometimes abrupt or unclear.  
[REPETITION] - Some ideas are repeated unnecessarily, which could be streamlined for better readability.  
[LOGIC] - The argument is generally logical but occasionally suffers from weak connections between premises and conclusions.
