-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
The story has a clear narrative structure and the overall chronology of Will Bradley's life and career is well presented. There is a logical progression from one chapter to the next, and the different phases of Bradley's life are connected. However, the abrupt transitions between paragraphs and sections, along with some inconsistencies in the narrative voice, slightly affect the overall coherence. The text could be improved with better transitions and a more consistent narrative approach.

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 3  
The text is generally readable and the story is engaging, but there are numerous grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and awkward phrasings that disrupt the flow. The inconsistent punctuation and spacing also affect readability. While the content is interesting and the narrative is mostly clear, the text would benefit significantly from proofreading and editing to correct the many fluency issues.

-> 4) Questions:  
None
