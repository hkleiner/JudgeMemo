-> 1) Issues:  
[GRAMMAR] - Several grammatical errors, such as incorrect verb forms ("we was taught", "the body was given", "it was a partaking", "he doth not receive").  
[SYNTAX] - Awkward or complex sentence structures that hinder readability, including long, run-on sentences and unclear clauses.  
[LEXICON] - Overuse of archaic or formal language ("doth", "thou", "hath", "was") that may confuse modern readers.  
[CLARITY] - Some ideas are expressed in a roundabout or overly technical manner, making the text difficult to follow.  
[TRANSITION] - Some transitions between paragraphs and ideas are abrupt or unclear, making the logical flow less smooth.  
[LOGIC] - In a few instances, arguments rely on assumptions or logical leaps that are not clearly explained.  

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
The text is generally coherent, with a clear structure and logical progression of ideas. The author maintains a consistent argument throughout, and the narrative is well-organized. There are only minor issues with transitions and clarity that slightly affect the overall flow, but the overall coherence is strong.  

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 3  
The text is mostly fluent, but it contains several grammatical and syntactical errors that affect readability. The use of archaic language and overly complex sentence structures makes the text feel less natural and harder to follow. These issues hinder the fluency of the text, though not to the point of making it completely difficult to understand.  

-> 4) Questions:  
None.
