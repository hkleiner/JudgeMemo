[LOGIC] - Some logical inconsistencies and abrupt shifts in narrative perspective (e.g., switching between first-person and third-person narration in different sections).  
[TRANSITION] - Poor transitions between paragraphs and chapters that make the narrative flow feel disjointed at times.  
[STRUCTURE] - The story is generally well-structured, but some sections could benefit from better organization and clearer connections between ideas.  
[CLARITY] - Certain phrases are unclear or ambiguous (e.g., "He discover American colonial typography" should be "He discovered American colonial typography").  

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
The story has a clear narrative structure and generally maintains a logical flow. It tells the life story of Will Bradley in a chronological manner with distinct chapters covering different periods of his life. There are some minor disconnected parts and abrupt shifts in perspective, but these do not significantly affect the overall coherence of the text. The narrative is generally well-organized and the ideas progress in a logical sequence.

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 3  
The text has some obvious grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that hinder the flow. While the language is generally clear and the story is engaging, there are numerous instances of incorrect verb tenses, subject-verb agreement issues, and awkward sentence structures. These issues make the text feel less polished and occasionally disrupt the reading experience, though they do not completely prevent understanding.
