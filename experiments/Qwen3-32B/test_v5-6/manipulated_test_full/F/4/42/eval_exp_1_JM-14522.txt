-> 1) Issues:  
[GRAMMAR] - Several grammatical errors including incorrect verb forms (e.g., "coulded was seen", "have am under the care", "have been was found", "have been dragged").  
[SYNTAX] - Awkward sentence structures and misplaced modifiers (e.g., "The day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the whole family went out to drive.").  
[LEXICON] - Inconsistent word usage and some inappropriate word choices (e.g., "turn upon ghosts" instead of "turn on ghosts", "have am quite unknown").  
[LOGIC] - Some logical inconsistencies in the flow of the narrative (e.g., the ghost's sudden change in behavior without clear cause).  
[STRUCTURE] - Some abrupt shifts in narrative perspective and time, which could confuse the reader.  
[CLARITY] - Certain phrases are unclear or ambiguous (e.g., "The blood-stain has been much admired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed." implies the stain is admired, which is confusing).  
[TRANSITION] - Some transitions between paragraphs and ideas are abrupt or missing, making the narrative flow less smooth.
