-> 1) Issues:  
[COHERENCE] - Some abrupt shifts between different time periods and topics without clear transitions  
[COHERENCE] - Occasional inconsistencies in narrative perspective (first-person vs. second-person)  
[COHERENCE] - Some sections feel disjointed due to the text's origins as compiled memoirs  
[COHERENCE] - The inclusion of anachronistic references (e.g., "The 3D printer finished the replica" in a historical narrative)  
[COHERENCE] - Some logical gaps in the narrative flow between events  
[FLUENCY] - A few instances of awkward phrasing and word choice  
[FLUENCY] - Some minor grammatical issues (e.g., "The script calls for slow music and heart-rending sob--another Kate Claxton in the Two Orphans")  
[FLUENCY] - A few instances of inconsistent punctuation and capitalization  
[FLUENCY] - Some sentences have unusual structures that make them slightly harder to parse  
[FLUENCY] - A few instances of missing or misplaced commas  

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 4  
-> 4) Questions:  
- Are the anachronistic references (like "The 3D printer finished the replica") intentional stylistic choices or errors?  
- Should the inconsistent narrative perspective be considered a stylistic choice or a coherence issue?
