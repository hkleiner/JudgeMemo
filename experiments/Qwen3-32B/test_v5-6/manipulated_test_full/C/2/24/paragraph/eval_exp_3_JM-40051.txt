-> 1) Issues: [GRAMMAR] (numerous grammatical errors, including missing commas, incorrect verb tenses, and subject-verb agreement issues)  
[SYNTAX] (awkward sentence structures, run-on sentences, and unclear phrasing)  
[LEXICON] (misused or archaic words, such as "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians" and "pleasantry" instead of "pleasantries")  
[LOGIC] (some arguments are illogical or unfounded, with leaps in reasoning that are not clearly supported)  
[STRUCTURE] (the narrative lacks a clear structure; it jumps between descriptions of the landscape, theological arguments, and historical references without smooth transitions)  
[CLARITY] (the author's claims are often unclear or overly complex, making it difficult to follow the main argument)  
[REPETITION] (the text contains repetitive phrases and ideas, such as repeated emphasis on "Come and see" and descriptions of the garden's grandeur)  
[TRANSITION] (the transitions between paragraphs and ideas are abrupt, lacking smooth flow)
