-> 1) Issues: [COHERENCE] (The story is complex and has multiple theories and interpretations that are presented in a dense, academic style. The narrative jumps between plot summary, character analysis, and evaluation of different theories without clear transitions. Some sections are repetitive and could be more logically organized.)  
[STRUCTURE] (The structure is somewhat disjointed with multiple sections and theories presented without clear connections. The flow between the introduction, plot summary, character analysis, and evaluation of theories could be improved.)  
[LOGIC] (Some arguments and theories are presented without sufficient evidence or explanation, making it difficult to follow the logical progression of ideas.)  
[CLARITY] (The dense academic style and complex sentence structures sometimes make the text difficult to follow, especially for readers unfamiliar with the subject matter.)  
[FLUENCY] (There are occasional awkward phrasings and some minor grammatical issues that slightly affect readability.)  
[LEXICON] (The vocabulary is appropriate for the academic style, but some words and phrases are overused or could be simplified for better clarity.)  

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
The story is generally coherent but suffers from a complex, academic style that makes it difficult to follow at times. The narrative jumps between different theories and interpretations without clear transitions, and some sections are repetitive or disorganized.  

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 4  
The text is mostly fluent with clear sentence structures and appropriate vocabulary. There are only a few minor grammatical issues and awkward phrasings that slightly affect readability.
