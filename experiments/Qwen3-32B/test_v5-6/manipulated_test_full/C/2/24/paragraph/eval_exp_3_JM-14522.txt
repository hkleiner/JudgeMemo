-> 1) Issues: [LEXICON] (use of anachronistic terms like "Tammany Rising Sun Lubricator" and "Pinkerton's Champion Stain Remover" in a 19th-century context), [STRUCTURE] (some abrupt shifts in narrative perspective, particularly in the transition between the ghost's internal monologue and the external action), [LOGIC] (inconsistent cause-and-effect relationships, such as the sudden reappearance of the blood stain despite the family's efforts to remove it), [SPELLING] (occasional spelling inconsistencies like "belle" vs. "belle"), [SYNTAX] (some awkward sentence structures, particularly in the ghost's long internal monologues), [TRANSITION] (some abrupt transitions between scenes and perspectives), [CLARITY] (occasional ambiguity in the ghost's motivations and the family's reactions), [TECHNICAL ANACHRONISM] (inappropriate modern technology references like "deepfake filter", "AI core recalibrated the system", "biosensor updated its readout", "self-driving cart turned left", etc.)
