-> 1) Issues:  
[STRUCTURE] The story is structured as a theological treatise, which is appropriate for its content, but the lack of a clear narrative or plot makes it feel more like an academic essay than a story.  
[CLARITY] Some sections are dense and complex, making it difficult to follow the argument for readers unfamiliar with theological terminology and debates.  
[TRANSITION] Some transitions between paragraphs are abrupt or unclear, especially when shifting between different sections or arguments.  
[LOGIC] While the overall argument is logical, some subsections contain overly long and repetitive explanations that could have been condensed for better clarity.  
[LEXICON] The text uses highly specialized theological vocabulary that may be inaccessible to general readers.  
[SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and complex, which can hinder readability and comprehension.
