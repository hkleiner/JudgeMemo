[TRANSITION] - The transitions between chapters and within chapters are often abrupt, making the story feel disjointed.  
[SYNTAX] - Some sentences are awkwardly constructed, with odd phrasing and word choice.  
[LEXICON] - There are instances of archaic or outdated language that could be confusing to modern readers.  
[GRAMMAR] - There are some grammatical errors, including missing articles and incorrect verb usage.

What is the significance of the many historical references and how do they relate to Will Bradley's story?
