-> 1) Issues:  
[GRAMMAR] - Several grammatical errors, including incorrect use of articles (e.g., "a stuff" instead of "the Church"), missing articles (e.g., "the thing" instead of "the Church"), and incorrect verb forms.  
[SYNTAX] - Awkward sentence structures, such as "But those who are loyal to a stuff ought not to be satisfied..." and "It is not my business now to discuss the connexion..."  
[LEXICON] - Use of archaic or unclear terms (e.g., "connexion" instead of "connection", "a thing" instead of "the Church") that make the text harder to understand.  
[LOGIC] - Some arguments lack logical clarity or flow, making it difficult to follow the reasoning. For example, the repeated use of "the thing" without clear reference can confuse the reader.  
[STRUCTURE] - Some sections are overly long and dense, which hinders readability and comprehension. The text could benefit from clearer paragraphing and section breaks.  
[CLARITY] - The use of ambiguous or vague terms (e.g., "a stuff", "the thing") reduces the clarity of the text. The reader is often left to infer the meaning of these terms.  
[TRANSITION] - The transitions between ideas and paragraphs are sometimes abrupt, making the narrative feel disjointed.  

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
The text is generally coherent and presents a clear argument about the Church of England's doctrine of the Lord's Supper. However, there are several instances where the use of vague or ambiguous terms like "a stuff" and "the thing" makes the narrative confusing. The structure could be improved with better paragraphing and clearer transitions. The argument is logical but is occasionally weakened by the unclear references and overly dense writing style.  

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 2  
The text has significant fluency issues. There are numerous grammatical errors, awkward sentence structures, and unclear or archaic word choices that hinder readability. The use of terms like "connexion" and "a thing" instead of more standard and clear language makes the text feel outdated and difficult to follow. The writing style is often dense and complex, which reduces fluency.  

-> 4) Questions:  
None
