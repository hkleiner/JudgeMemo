-> 1) Issues:  
[GRAMMAR] - Repeated use of "the stuff" in place of proper nouns (e.g., "Lord the stuff", "the stuff family").  
[GRAMMAR] - Inconsistent use of "a thing" in place of specific words (e.g., "a thing and Paragon Detergent", "a thing ghost").  
[STRUCTURE] - Repetitive use of phrases and sentences that disrupt the flow of the narrative.  
[LOGIC] - Inconsistencies in the ghost's behavior and the family's reactions that make the story less coherent.  
[CLARITY] - Ambiguous references to characters and events due to missing or incorrect names.  
[TRANSITION] - Some abrupt shifts between scenes and ideas, making the narrative feel disjointed.  
[LEXICON] - Use of placeholder words like "the stuff" and "a thing" instead of actual names or objects.  
[SYNTAX] - Some awkward sentence structures and missing punctuation.
