-> 1) Issues:  
[GRAMMAR] - Numerous grammatical errors, including missing prepositions ("on the principle of 'first know you are right, then go ahead'"), incorrect verb tenses ("have ventured to publish it"), and subject-verb agreement issues ("It has appeared in brief articles in the thing").  
[SYNTAX] - Awkward and confusing sentence structures, such as run-on sentences and unclear clauses ("But by degrees it has been opening to the minds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere on the American Continent").  
[LEXICON] - Use of incorrect or unclear words, such as "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians," "a thing" as a placeholder, and "stuff" as a generic term for locations or objects.  
[COHERENCE] - The text lacks logical flow and transitions between ideas, making it difficult to follow the narrative. The author jumps between describing the garden, biblical references, and geographic features without clear connections.  
[STRUCTURE] - The text is repetitive and lacks a clear organizational structure. Many ideas are introduced and then abandoned or repeated without development.  
[CLARITY] - The text is often unclear or ambiguous, with vague references to places and concepts. The author frequently uses phrases like "a thing" or "the stuff," which make it difficult to understand the intended meaning.  
[TRANSITION] - The text lacks smooth transitions between paragraphs and ideas, making it difficult to follow the author's reasoning.  
[REPETITION] - The author repeats the same ideas multiple times, such as the claim that the described location is the Garden of Eden, without adding new information or evidence.  

-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2  
The text is largely incoherent, with many disconnected parts and inconsistencies. The narrative lacks a clear progression, and the author frequently jumps between topics without logical transitions. While some ideas are understandable, the overall structure and flow of the text make it difficult to follow and comprehend the author's main argument.  

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 2  
The text contains major grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and syntactic issues that significantly hinder readability. The frequent use of placeholder words like "a thing" and "the stuff" further disrupts the flow. While there are some fluent segments, the overall text is not easy to read and requires significant effort to understand.
