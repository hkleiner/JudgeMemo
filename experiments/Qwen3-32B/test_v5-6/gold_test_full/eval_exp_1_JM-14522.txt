-> 1) Issues:  
[COHERENCE] - The story is generally coherent, but there are occasional abrupt shifts in tone and perspective, particularly in the transition between the American family's reactions and the ghost's internal monologues.  
[COHERENCE] - Some plot elements are introduced with little foreshadowing, such as the ghost's final redemption and Virginia's role in it, which could feel slightly disjointed to some readers.  
[COHERENCE] - The story's structure is well-organized, but the resolution involving the ghost's death and Virginia's secret could be more clearly connected to earlier clues.  
[FLUENCY] - The text is mostly fluent and grammatically correct, with only minor issues.  
[FLUENCY] - Some sentences are overly long and complex, which can hinder readability.  
[FLUENCY] - There are a few instances of awkward phrasing or word choice, such as "the powers of Hell cannot prevail," which could be smoother.  
[LEXICON] - The use of archaic and British English vocabulary (e.g., "chamber," "curtsey," "solicitude") is consistent but may require some adjustment for clarity in certain contexts.  
[LEXICON] - The mix of American and British spellings is generally consistent, but it could cause minor confusion for some readers.
