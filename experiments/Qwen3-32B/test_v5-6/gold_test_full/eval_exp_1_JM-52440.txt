-> 2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
The text is generally coherent and presents a clear thesis about the doctrine of the Lord's Supper in the Church of England. However, the length and complexity of the text, combined with some abrupt shifts and repetitive sections, hinder the overall coherence and make it difficult to follow the narrative as a whole.

-> 3) FINAL Fluency Score: 4  
The text is mostly fluent and well-written. The language is formal and archaic in style, but it is grammatically correct and the sentences flow well. There are some complex sentences and phrases that may be challenging for some readers, but these do not significantly disrupt the fluency of the text.
