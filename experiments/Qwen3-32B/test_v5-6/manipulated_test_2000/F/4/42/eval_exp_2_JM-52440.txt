-> 1) Issues:  
[GRAMMAR] - Multiple subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "am the true expositors," "was the real point at issue," "there was no authoritative documents").  
[GRAMMAR] - Incorrect use of verb tenses (e.g., "was not the present question," "we was taught," "we being many, are one bread").  
[GRAMMAR] - Improper use of modal verbs (e.g., "to was directed," "to was determined," "to was the sons of God").  
[SYNTAX] - Awkward and non-standard phrasing (e.g., "the point was supposed to had been settle," "I am perfectly safe in arranged the three principal points").  
[SYNTAX] - Run-on sentences and missing punctuation in complex constructions.  
[LEXICON] - Misused or incorrect word forms (e.g., "consisted in nothing more than confident assertion," "the elements of water").  
[LOGIC] - Some sentences are repetitive or lack clear logical progression (e.g., "But the practical conclusion is the same, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the wine").  
[CLARITY] - Ambiguous phrasing in some theological explanations, making it hard to follow the intended meaning (e.g., "the sign woulded cease to be a sign if it am changed into the thing signify").  
[STRUCTURE] - Paragraphs are long and dense, making it difficult to follow the argument without frequent re-reading.
