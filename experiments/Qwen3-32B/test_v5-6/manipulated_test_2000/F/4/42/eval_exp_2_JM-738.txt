-> 1) Issues:  
[GRAMMAR] - Multiple grammatical errors such as "he certainly write no longer", "he speak to his sister-in-law", "he die in June", "points very dark seemed", "He see in his vision", "he might had fallen", "there was two specimens", "If I was right", "Mr. Cuming Walters suggests that she was the mother of John Jasper, and, therefore, maternal grandmother of Edwin Drood".  
[SYNTAX] - Awkward sentence structures and misplaced modifiers, e.g., "He speak to his sister-in-law, Miss Hogarth, about his fear that he had not sufficiently concealed his tracks in the latest numbers."  
[LEXICON] - Misused or incorrect word choices, e.g., "babbleed", "opiumed", "babbleed", "coulded", "has am a victim", "must was unintelligible", "has am a determined drunkard".  
[CLARITY] - Some sentences are unclear due to poor phrasing or missing context, e.g., "He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character."  
[STRUCTURE] - Some sections lack clear transitions, making the overall structure feel slightly disjointed.  
[TRANSITION] - Some abrupt shifts in narrative, e.g., from analysis to character description, could benefit from smoother transitions.  
[LOGIC] - Minor inconsistencies in logic, e.g., "If I was right" instead of "If I were right".
