-> 1) Issues:  
[GRAMMAR] - Multiple grammatical errors such as "IR" instead of "It is", "as ifmthey" instead of "as if they", "doctrime" instead of "doctrine", "tue" instead of "the", "vand" instead of "and".  
[SPELLING] - Numerous misspellings including "unvommon", "confidenve", "srrvice", "blessed Saviour" (missing apostrophe), "1 Vor. x. 16, 17" (likely a reference to 1 Corinthians 10:16-17 but poorly formatted), "tue", "RealnPresence", "consecration produces no change in its quality or substance" (missing article).  
[SYNTAX] - Awkward and fragmented sentence structures such as "It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not the present question." and "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject."  
[LEXICON] - Use of archaic or overly formal language that may reduce clarity for modern readers.  
[LOGIC] - Some sections appear to shift abruptly from one idea to another without clear transitions, particularly in the discussion of sacraments and doctrine.  
[STRUCTURE] - The overall structure is somewhat disjointed in places, with some paragraphs beginning without clear connection to the previous one.  
[CLARITY] - Certain phrases are ambiguous or unclear, such as "the real groundworknof that opinion" and "we are all partakers of that one bread."
