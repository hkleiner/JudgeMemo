-> 1) Issues:  
[GRAMMAR] - Several grammatical errors, such as "assiduously cultivated" missing a comma, "demned outline" missing an article, "assurtsly" (misspelled), "deserfed" (misspelled), "ajd" (misspelled), "romam policier" (misspelled), "notvout" (misspelled), "not unpleasant contrast with the pathetic Jo of _Bleak House_" missing a comma, "atmosphers" (misspelled), "x lack" (should be "a lack"), "kpium den" (misspelled), "fromcthe life" (misspelled), "conceaoed" (misspelled), "there arectwo specimens" (misspelled), "thebsupernormal" (misspelled), "agrd" (misspelled), "a-ysar" (misspelled), "thickmblack" (misspelled), "ovwr" (misspelled), "nickjamed" (misspelled), "bexfre" (misspelled), "fhat" (misspelled), "tjis" (misspelled), "uncomfortable terms: she does not love him, while he perhaps does love her, but is annoyed by her manner, and by the gossip about their betrothal." (awkward phrasing), "he says to his friend, uncle, and confidant, Jasper" (awkward phrasing).  
[SYNTAX] - Awkward sentence structures and missing punctuation in multiple places, such as "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets ajd surprises." and "He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _romam policier_, careful study of character."  
[CLARITY] - Some phrases are ambiguous or unclear, such as "We think if Scott’s earlier seuzures of a similar kind, after which _Peveril_, he said, “smacked of the apoplexy.”" and "He saw in his vision, “_that_, I never saw _that_ before.”"  
[LOGIC] - Some logical jumps or unclear connections between ideas, such as the abrupt transition from discussing Dickens’s health to the plot of *The Mystery of Edwin Drood*.  
[STRUCTURE] - The story is well-structured in terms of narrative progression, but the language and syntax issues disrupt the flow and clarity.  
[LEXICON] - Some archaic or overly complex word choices that may confuse modern readers, such as "hab nab at a venture" and "romam policier."
