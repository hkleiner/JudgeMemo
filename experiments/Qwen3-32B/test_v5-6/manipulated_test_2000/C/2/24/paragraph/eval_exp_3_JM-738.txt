-> 1) Issues:  
[STRUCTURE] The story is presented in an academic or critical tone rather than a narrative, making it feel more like a literary analysis than a story.  
[LOGIC] The flow of the narrative is disrupted by the inclusion of analytical commentary, which breaks the reader's immersion.  
[CLARITY] Some parts are overly complex and dense, especially in the introduction, making it difficult to follow the plot.  
[TRANSITION] Transitions between sections are abrupt and lack smooth progression.  
[LEXICON] Some word choices are archaic or overly formal (e.g., "hab nab at a venture," "restraint which she puts on her 'tigerish blood'"), which may confuse modern readers.  
[SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, affecting readability.  
[GRAMMAR] Minor grammatical inconsistencies and punctuation issues (e.g., missing commas, inconsistent use of quotation marks).  
[REPETITION] Certain phrases and ideas are repeated without clear purpose, such as the discussion of Jasperâ€™s opium use.
