-> 1) Issues:  
[GRAMMAR] - Several missing articles or prepositions (e.g., "the editor’s sanctum is at the front. His desk is at the big window").  
[SYNTAX] - Some awkward or incomplete sentences (e.g., "The editor’s sanctum is at the front. His desk is at the big window").  
[STRUCTURE] - Sudden shifts in narrative style between the two chapters without clear transitions.  
[LOGIC] - Some historical and biographical details are unclear or confusing (e.g., the mention of Roosevelt’s lawsuit without context).  
[TRANSITION] - Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs and ideas, especially in the second chapter.  
[LEXICON] - Some word choices are inconsistent or unclear (e.g., "the editor is an inveterate sportsman" followed by an incomplete sentence).  
[REPETITION] - Some phrases and ideas are repeated unnecessarily.  
[CONTEXT] - The mention of unrelated or out-of-place sentences (e.g., "The home assistant played ambient music," "A livestream began recording," "The energy grid remained balanced") disrupts the narrative flow.
