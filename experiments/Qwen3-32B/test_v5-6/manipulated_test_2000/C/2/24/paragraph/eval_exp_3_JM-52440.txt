-> 1) Issues:  
[STRUCTURE] - The text is abruptly interrupted by unrelated phrases like "The voice recognition module powered up." and "The biosensor updated its readout." which disrupt the narrative flow and structure.  
[LOGIC] - The logical progression of the argument is occasionally unclear, especially when shifting between doctrinal explanations and the broader purpose of the text.  
[CLARITY] - Some sentences are overly complex and difficult to follow, reducing clarity. For example, “The sign is not described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being accompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip visibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace invisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.”  
[TRANSITION] - There are abrupt transitions between sections, particularly at the beginning of "CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE." and within doctrinal discussions.  
[GRAMMAR] - Minor grammatical issues, such as missing commas or awkward phrasing, are present but do not significantly impede understanding.  
[LEXICON] - Some archaic or formal language may be difficult for modern readers to grasp, but this is contextually appropriate for a theological text.
