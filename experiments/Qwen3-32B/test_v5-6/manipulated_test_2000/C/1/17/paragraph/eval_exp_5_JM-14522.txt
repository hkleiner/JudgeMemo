-> 1) Issues:  
[LOGIC] The story shifts abruptly between multiple unrelated narratives (e.g., Dickens, Stransom, Mary Antrim, Paul Creston) without clear connections to the main plot of *The Canterville Ghost*.  
[STRUCTURE] The narrative lacks a consistent structure; it begins with the Otis family's arrival at Canterville Chase but then digresses into unrelated anecdotes and reflections.  
[CLARITY] Some sections are unclear or confusing (e.g., the interjection about Christmas and summer holidays is irrelevant and disrupts the narrative flow).  
[TRANSITION] Poor transitions between paragraphs and chapters, especially between the ghostly encounters and the unrelated reflections on Dickens or Stransom.  
[GRAMMAR] Minor grammatical issues, such as "He had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion..." which is awkwardly phrased.  
[SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly complex and hard to follow, e.g., "What I mean to insinuate, and to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and distressing conviction of unreality..."  
[LEXICON] Use of archaic or overly elaborate language in some parts, which contrasts with the modern tone of the American characters.  
[REPETITION] Repetition of the blood-stain motif without sufficient narrative buildup or resolution.
