-> 1) Issues:  
[LOGIC] Sudden shift from introducing Will Bradley to analyzing Dickensâ€™s last plot, which is unrelated to the subject.  
[LOGIC] The introduction abruptly ends with a mention of Mr. William Archer, then shifts to unrelated historical anecdotes about American typographic design.  
[LOGIC] A long, disjointed passage about Stransom, Mary Antrim, and Paul Creston is inserted without context or relevance to the main subject.  
[LOGIC] The story then shifts to a chapter about the childhood of "Willie" in Ishpeming, but it is unclear if this is a fictionalized account of Will Bradley or a separate narrative.  
[STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear narrative thread and jumps between unrelated topics and characters.  
[CLARITY] The purpose of the introduction is unclear, and the connection between the author and the subject is not well established.  
[CLARITY] The mention of "Sir Simon" and the blood-stain in the Chase is abrupt and unrelated to the rest of the text.  
[TRANSITION] There are no smooth transitions between the introduction, the Dickens reference, the Stransom episode, and the childhood story.  
[GRAMMAR] Minor grammatical errors such as missing punctuation, inconsistent capitalization, and missing quotation marks.  
[SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and difficult to follow, especially in the Stransom section.
