-> 1) Issues:  
[STRUCTURE] The story is a jumbled collection of unrelated fragments, including parts about the Garden of Eden, a romantic subplot involving Jasper and Rosa, a description of Canterville Chase, and a narrative about a Life Assurance Office. There is no clear narrative thread or logical progression.  
[LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly from one idea to another with no explanation or connection, making it difficult to follow a single storyline.  
[TRANSITION] There are no smooth transitions between the different narrative segments, causing confusion and disorientation.  
[GRAMMAR] Several grammatical errors are present, such as "admirirg" instead of "admiring", "dimentions" instead of "dimensions", and "consitutes" instead of "constitutes".  
[SYNTAX] The syntax is often awkward and unclear, for example "But having become thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured to publish it" lacks a subject and is grammatically incorrect.  
[LEXICON] Some word choices are inappropriate or confusing, such as "the finger of time has been plainly pointing" and "the bloom is off the plum".  
[CLARITY] The meaning of the text is frequently unclear due to disjointed ideas and lack of explanation.
