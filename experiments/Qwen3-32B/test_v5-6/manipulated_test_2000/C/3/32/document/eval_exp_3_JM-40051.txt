-> 1) Issues:  
[GRAMMAR] – Numerous grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb forms, and sentence fragments (e.g., "have ventured to publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the thing").  
[SYNTAX] – Awkward and confusing sentence structures, especially in longer sentences.  
[LEXICON] – Use of incorrect or unclear words (e.g., "the thing", "a stuff", "the stuff", "a thing", "a fabled dog").  
[CLARITY] – The narrative is often unclear and repetitive, making it difficult to follow the author's logic.  
[LOGIC] – The argument for the Garden of Eden being in the Mississippi River valley is weak and lacks logical progression.  
[STRUCTURE] – The story lacks a clear and consistent structure; it jumps between descriptions, assertions, and unsupported claims.  
[TRANSITION] – Poor transitions between paragraphs and ideas, resulting in a disjointed flow.  
[REPETITION] – Repeated phrases and ideas without development or new information.  
[CONSISTENCY] – Inconsistent use of terms and references (e.g., "the thing", "a stuff") that confuse the reader.
