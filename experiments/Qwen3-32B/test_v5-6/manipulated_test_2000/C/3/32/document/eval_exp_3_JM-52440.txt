-> 1) Issues:  
[GRAMMAR] - Repeated use of the phrase "the stuff" instead of "the Church" or "the Church of England," which is likely a typo or placeholder error.  
[GRAMMAR] - Repeated use of "a thing" and "the thing" in the introduction, which is unclear and grammatically incorrect.  
[STRUCTURE] - The text is highly repetitive in its argumentation, with similar points being restated multiple times without adding clarity.  
[CLARITY] - Some phrases are overly abstract or theological, making the meaning difficult to follow for a general reader (e.g., "the communion of the blood of Christ").  
[LEXICON] - The use of archaic or overly formal language (e.g., "thou," "ye," "thus far") may hinder readability for modern audiences.  
[LOGIC] - The flow of the argument occasionally jumps between ideas without clear transitions, making it harder to follow the progression of the narrative.  
[TRANSITION] - Some paragraphs begin abruptly without connecting to the previous one, reducing the overall coherence of the text.
