-> 1) Issues:  
[GRAMMAR] - Several grammatical errors such as missing articles, incorrect subject-verb agreement, and sentence fragments.  
[SYNTAX] - Awkward and overly complex sentence structures that make the text difficult to follow.  
[LEXICON] - Use of inconsistent or unclear terms like “a stuff,” “the stuff,” and “a thing” without clear references.  
[LOGIC] - Some ideas are introduced without sufficient explanation or logical connection to the rest of the text.  
[CLARITY] - The narrative is often confusing due to vague references and unclear character relationships.  
[STRUCTURE] - The flow between sections is sometimes abrupt, and the introduction of characters and plot points lacks smooth transitions.
