-> 1) Issues:  
[GRAMMAR] - Several grammatical errors including missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and subject-verb agreement issues.  
[SYNTAX] - Awkward sentence structures and run-on sentences that hinder readability.  
[SPELLING] - Misspellings such as “antldiluvians,” “admirirg,” “dimentions,” “scientest,” “Jordon,” “consitutes,” “hightest,” “jageed.”  
[LEXICON] - Inconsistent or imprecise word choices, such as “pleasantry” instead of “joke,” and overuse of archaic or overly formal language.  
[LOGIC] - Some claims lack logical support or transition, making the argument feel disjointed or speculative without clear evidence.  
[STRUCTURE] - The narrative jumps between descriptions of the landscape and theological claims without clear organization.  
[CLARITY] - Ambiguous or unclear sentences, especially in the theological and geographical explanations, make the overall message hard to follow.  
[TRANSITION] - Poor transitions between paragraphs and ideas, especially between the discovery and the detailed description of the location.
