-> 1) Issues:  
[STRUCTURE] The story is divided into two distinct chapters, but the transition between them is abrupt and lacks a clear narrative link.  
[LOGIC] The second chapter jumps through time and events in a somewhat disjointed manner, making it difficult to follow the chronological flow of the protagonistâ€™s life.  
[CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and lack clarity, such as "Having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay of a lower-case beside the window--where you can proudly wave to the schoolchildren as they are going home to their noon meal."  
[SYNTAX] There are a few awkward phrasings, such as "You are put to work washing-up a Gordon press. Then you receive your first lesson in feeding."  
[GRAMMAR] Minor grammatical inconsistencies, such as missing commas and inconsistent use of punctuation.  
[LEXICON] Some word choices are unusual or archaic, which may hinder fluency for modern readers, such as "devil" used to describe an assistant in the print shop.  
[TRANSITION] The transition from the introduction to the second chapter is abrupt and lacks a smooth narrative bridge.  
[PUNCTUATION] The use of em dashes and parentheses is inconsistent, which affects readability.
