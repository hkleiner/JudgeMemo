-> 1) Issues:  
[STRUCTURE] The text is a literary analysis of *The Mystery of Edwin Drood*, but it lacks a clear narrative structure in the "Story" section, making it feel more like an essay than a story.  
[LOGIC] Some parts are confusing or lack clear logical progression, especially in the analysis of characters and theories about the plot.  
[CLARITY] Certain phrases are overly academic or verbose, reducing clarity for general readers.  
[SYNTAX] A few sentences are overly long and complex, making them difficult to follow.  
[LEXICON] Some archaic or obscure word choices may hinder readability for modern audiences.  
[TRANSITION] The transition between the introduction and the "Story" section is abrupt, and the flow between ideas is not always smooth.
