Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The story is generally well-structured, but there are a few abrupt transitions between scenes, especially between the introduction of characters and the sudden appearance of the ghost.  
- [LOGIC] The reappearance of the blood stain after being cleaned is not thoroughly explained, making it slightly confusing for the reader.  
- [CLARITY] The references to specific American products (e.g., Pinkerton's Stain Remover, Tammany Rising Sun Lubricator) are clear but feel slightly out of place in a narrative otherwise set in a traditional English setting.  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors were found.  
- [GRAMMAR] No grammatical errors were found.  
- [SYNTAX] The syntax is generally correct and well-constructed.  
- [LEXICON] The vocabulary is rich and appropriate for the genre, with some archaic or formal language that suits the gothic tone.  
- [PUNCTUATION] The punctuation is mostly correct, though there are a few instances of missing commas in complex sentences.  
- [AMBIGUITY] A few phrases are ambiguous, such as "I guess the old country is so overpopulated that they have not enough decent weather for everybody," which is unclear in its intended meaning.  
- [INCONSISTENCY] The story maintains a consistent tone and character behavior, but the introduction of anachronistic elements (e.g., a hologram and a bluetooth signal) disrupts the historical setting and feels jarring.
