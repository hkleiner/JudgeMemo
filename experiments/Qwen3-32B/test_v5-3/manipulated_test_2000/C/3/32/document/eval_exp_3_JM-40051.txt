Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The story lacks a clear narrative structure; it jumps between descriptions of the location, biblical references, and historical anecdotes without a coherent flow.  
- [LOGIC] The argument that the Garden of Eden is located in the Mississippi River valley is not logically supported and relies heavily on subjective interpretations and weak analogies.  
- [CLARITY] The text is often unclear due to vague references (e.g., "the thing," "a stuff") and inconsistent use of terms (e.g., "Euphrates" vs. "Mississippi").  
- [SPELLING] Multiple spelling errors are present, such as "antldiluvians," "admirirg," "dimentions," "jageed," and "antideluvians."  
- [GRAMMAR] Several grammatical errors appear, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and run-on sentences.  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward and overly complex sentence structures disrupt the readability of the text.  
- [LEXICON] The use of archaic or inappropriate word choices (e.g., "thing," "stuff") and unclear phrasing reduces clarity.  
- [TRANSITION] There is a lack of transitional phrases between ideas, making the narrative feel disjointed and abrupt.
