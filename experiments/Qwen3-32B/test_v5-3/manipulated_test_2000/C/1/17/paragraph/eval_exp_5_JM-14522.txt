Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The story abruptly shifts from a ghostly narrative to a discussion about Dickens and Edwin Drood, then back to the ghost story, creating a jarring and incoherent structure.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of Dickens and the Drood mystery is irrelevant to the main plot and lacks a logical connection to the Canterville Ghost narrative.  
- [COHERENCE] The story lacks a clear narrative flow between the different scenes and characters, especially between the ghostly encounters and the unrelated reflections on Christmas and holiday sentiment.  
- [TRANSITION] There are no smooth transitions between the different narrative segments, making the story feel disjointed and confusing.  
- [SPELLING] Minor spelling issues such as "phantasmata" and "Sanguineous" may be intentional but are stylistically jarring and disrupt fluency.  
- [LEXICON] The use of overly complex or archaic vocabulary (e.g., "mysterious race," "objective existence of phantasmata") is inconsistent with the overall tone and readability of the text.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Some sentences are overly long and lack proper punctuation, making them difficult to follow (e.g., the long sentence about Christmas sentiment).  

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
