Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The story abruptly shifts from the introduction of Will Bradley to a seemingly unrelated narrative involving Stransom and Paul Creston, creating confusion about the story's focus.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative about Stransom and the jeweller’s shop is disconnected from the main subject, Will Bradley, and lacks a clear purpose or integration into the overall story.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "Sir Simon" and the blood-stain in the Chase is introduced without context, making it unclear how it relates to the rest of the text.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the childhood of Will Bradley to the unrelated Stransom episode is abrupt and lacks any narrative bridge or explanation.  
- [SPELLING] Minor spelling issues, such as "Narrow Gauge" and "picklelime," are used without explanation, potentially confusing the reader.  
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly complex or awkwardly structured, such as “He detached his arm from his companion’s to grasp the hand of the older friend.”  
- [LEXICON] Some word choices are archaic or unclear in context, such as “devil” used to refer to an assistant in the print shop.
