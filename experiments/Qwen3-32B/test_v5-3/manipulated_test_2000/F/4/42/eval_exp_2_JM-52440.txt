Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Multiple subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "am the true expositors", "was the real point at issue", "was not now making any assertion").  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect use of verb tenses (e.g., "to had been settle", "to was directed", "to was the sons of God").  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect use of infinitives and modals (e.g., "to was confounded", "to was the sons of God", "to was directed").  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect prepositions and phrasing (e.g., "in connexion with", "in some way or other connect with", "to was the sons of God").  
- [SPELLING] Misspelled words (e.g., "wased" instead of "was", "wased" instead of "was", "wased" instead of "was").  
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic or overly formal language that may be confusing to modern readers (e.g., "warrant to expected", "beared", "wased").  
- [LOGIC] Some logical inconsistencies in argumentation, such as the assertion that the Church of England's doctrine is not about transubstantiation, but the discussion then continues with detailed comparisons to Roman Catholic doctrine without clear resolution.  
- [CLARITY] The text is dense and complex, with long sentences that make it difficult to follow the logical progression of ideas.  
- [STRUCTURE] The structure is somewhat disjointed, with frequent shifts in focus and a lack of clear transitions between paragraphs.
