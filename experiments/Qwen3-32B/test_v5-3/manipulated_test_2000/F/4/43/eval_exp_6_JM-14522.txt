Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Several grammatical errors and sentence fragments are present, such as "I it at short ghost money that, as public time thing there we and or; have in I if all in can".  
- [SPELLING] There are spelling mistakes and typos, such as "raged The particular fiercely but II of, note that storm all night occurred."  
- [SYNTAX] The syntax is often incorrect or incoherent, especially in the paragraph where Washington Otis speaks, making it difficult to understand.  
- [STRUCTURE] The second chapter is titled "CHAPTER: nothing" and begins with a sentence that is fragmented and poorly structured.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative flow is disrupted by the nonsensical and incoherent sentences, especially in the middle of the story where the text becomes inaudible and unclear.  
- [CLARITY] Some parts of the text are unclear or ambiguous, especially the long, run-on sentences that lack punctuation or logical flow.  
- [TRANSITION] There is a lack of smooth transitions between some paragraphs and sections, particularly after the first chapter ends and the second begins.
