Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The story lacks a clear and logical organization; it jumps between ideas and descriptions without a consistent narrative flow.  
- [LOGIC] The argument for identifying the Garden of Eden in the Mississippi River Valley is weak and not well-supported with coherent reasoning.  
- [CLARITY] The text is often vague and ambiguous, making it difficult to follow the author’s claims or conclusions.  
- [SPELLING] There are multiple spelling errors (e.g., "antldiluvians", "admirirg", "dimentions", "Bridtish", "jageed").  
- [GRAMMAR] Grammatical errors are frequent, including incorrect verb tenses, missing articles, and improper sentence structure.  
- [SYNTAX] The syntax is often awkward or overly complex, leading to confusion.  
- [LEXICON] Word choice is sometimes imprecise or inappropriate for the context (e.g., "destitute of money mineral wealth", "river "below greed,"").  
- [TRANSITION] There is a lack of effective transitions between paragraphs and ideas, leading to a disjointed reading experience.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Punctuation is inconsistently used or missing in several places, disrupting the flow of the text.  
- [REPETITION] The same ideas are repeated multiple times without adding new information.  
- [INCOHERENT PASSAGES] Several passages are incoherent or nonsensical (e.g., "Nineteen been at lost a, bound up thinking would had, being river “below greed,” on, doubtless eastward miles get Their they they to...").
