Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Multiple spelling errors throughout the text (e.g., "unvommon," "confidenve," "doctrime," "groundnwork," "blessed Saviour," "prssent," "vitz.", "consecration produces no change in its quality or substance").  
- [GRAMMAR] Several grammatical errors, including incorrect verb forms, subject-verb agreement issues, and incorrect use of prepositions.  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward and overly complex sentence structures that hinder readability.  
- [LEXICON] Inconsistent or incorrect word usage (e.g., "badye" instead of "badge," "tue" instead of "the," "real objective presence" is unclear in context).  
- [CLARITY] Some concepts are expressed ambiguously, making the argument harder to follow.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between ideas and paragraphs, leading to a choppy reading experience.  
- [STRUCTURE] While the text is logically divided into chapters and sections, the internal flow within paragraphs is uneven and occasionally disjointed.
