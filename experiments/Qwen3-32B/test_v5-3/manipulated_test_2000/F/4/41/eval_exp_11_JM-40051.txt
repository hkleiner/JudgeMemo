It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT", "But having become thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it", "he could not point it out to them—and as the country...").  
- [STRUCTURE] Poor organization and lack of clear progression in ideas. The narrative jumps between theological claims, geographical descriptions, and personal anecdotes without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] Weak logical connections between ideas. The argument for Eden being in the Mississippi River valley is based on speculative and unproven assertions.  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous and vague descriptions make it difficult to follow the author’s reasoning or visualize the described location.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between sections and paragraphs, making the text feel disjointed.  
- [LEXICON] Inconsistent and sometimes inappropriate word choice (e.g., "prlper dimentions", "beau ideal", "unequalled").

- [REPETITION] Repetition of phrases and ideas (e.g., “Our garden is still in the right plafe,” “Our garden is again right”).
