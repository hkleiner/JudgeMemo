Issues:

- [GRAMMAR] Sentence fragments and missing articles: "The employees wre all natives--Universalists and Unitarians, probably." "You have a little express wagon. You carry finished work back to the factories and rethrn with a supply of unfinished."  
- [STRUCTURE] The story jumps abruptly between different events and time periods without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the chronological flow of the protagonist’s life.  
- [LOGIC] Some events appear out of order or lack clear cause-and-effect relationships. For example, the protagonist's sudden transition from school to work is not well explained.  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references and unclear pronouns: "He gives you much fine advice which you never forget." It is unclear who "he" refers to in some contexts.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs and events, especially in the second chapter, where the story moves quickly from childhood to adulthood with little narrative glue.  
- [LEXICON] Use of inconsistent or incorrect word forms, such as "esucation" instead of "education" and "freauently" instead of "frequently."  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or incorrect punctuation in several places, including missing commas and quotation marks.  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structures and run-on sentences that disrupt the flow of the narrative.
