- [LEXICON] Inconsistent or unclear word choice, such as "Youth will be served;" and "notvout of reason."  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguity in meaning, especially in phrases like "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets ajd surprises."  
- [STRUCTURE] The text has a somewhat logical flow but lacks smooth transitions between paragraphs, especially in the "OPENING OF THE TALE" and "SAPSEA AND DURDLES" sections.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts in topic or scene, particularly in the transition from Jasper’s opium den to Cloisterham.
