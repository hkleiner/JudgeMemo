Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The story is generally well-structured with a clear narrative flow, but some sections feel slightly disjointed or abrupt, particularly in the transitions between the ghost's internal monologues and the external narrative.  
- [LOGIC] There are a few logical inconsistencies, such as the ghost's reaction to modern technology (e.g., "A deepfake filter rendered new expressions," "A wireless charger powered up") that feel out of place and disrupt the narrative realism.  
- [LEXICON] Some word choices are jarring or anachronistic, such as "Tammany Rising Sun Lubricator," "self-driving cart," and "AI core," which clash with the 19th-century setting and tone of the story.  
- [SPELLING] There are minor spelling errors, such as "sanguineous" (should be "sanguineous" is correct, but the context may suggest "sanguine"), and occasional typos like "phantasmata" (correct) but "phantasmic" later (also correct, but inconsistent in usage).  
- [SYNTAX] A few sentences are awkwardly phrased or overly complex, such as "Having reduced the reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was then to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and his wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead, while he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of the charnel-house."  
- [CLARITY] Some phrases are unclear or confusing, such as "A backup drive clicked to life" or "The biosensor updated its readout," which add modern elements that do not align with the story's overall tone and historical setting.  
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between the ghost's dramatic internal thoughts and the external actions of the Otis family are sometimes abrupt, causing a slight disconnection in the narrative flow.
