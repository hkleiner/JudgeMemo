Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The story is a theological treatise and lacks narrative structure, character development, and a clear plot. It reads more like a doctrinal essay than a story.  
- [COHERENCE] The content is dense and complex, making it difficult to follow for readers unfamiliar with the subject matter. The lack of a narrative thread reduces overall coherence.  
- [LOGIC] The logical progression of the text is clear within the theological argument, but the story lacks a broader narrative logic that would make it engaging as a piece of fiction or storytelling.  
- [CLARITY] The language is formal and archaic, which may obscure the meaning for modern readers. The dense theological terminology and long sentences reduce clarity.  
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between sections are abrupt and lack narrative flow. The story lacks the smooth transitions that would be expected in a more traditional narrative form.  
- [PLOT] The absence of a plot, characters, and narrative progression makes the text unsuitable as a story. It is more appropriate as a theological treatise or academic essay.  
- [READABILITY] The text is not reader-friendly for those not familiar with the subject. The dense and formal style makes it inaccessible to a general audience.
