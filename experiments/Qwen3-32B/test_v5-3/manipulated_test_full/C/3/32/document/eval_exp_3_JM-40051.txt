Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The story is extremely long and meandering, making it difficult to follow a clear narrative or argument. It jumps between descriptions of geography, religious interpretations, and historical references without a clear structure.
- [LOGIC] The story lacks logical progression. It attempts to prove that a specific geographical location in the United States is the biblical Garden of Eden, but the argument is unfocused and repetitive, with no clear thesis or supporting evidence.
- [CLARITY] The writing is often unclear and confusing. The author frequently uses vague or undefined terms and makes unsupported claims.
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between ideas are abrupt and often nonexistent. The story reads more like a disjointed collection of observations than a coherent narrative.
- [SPELLING] There are numerous spelling errors throughout the text, including "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians" and "jageed" instead of "jagged."
- [GRAMMAR] The text contains many grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect use of prepositions, and missing articles.
- [SYNTAX] The sentence structure is often awkward and convoluted, making it difficult to understand the author's intended meaning.
- [LEXICON] The author uses many archaic or inappropriate word choices that make the text harder to understand, such as "a thing" and "the stuff."
- [REPETITION] The text is repetitive, with the author frequently restating the same points without adding new information.
- [TONE] The tone is overly enthusiastic and lacks objectivity, making it difficult to take the author's claims seriously.
