Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The story is long and contains many chapters, making it difficult to follow a single narrative thread. The structure is more of a biographical account with multiple sections rather than a unified story.  
- [LOGIC] Some sections jump abruptly from one topic to another without clear transitions or logical connections, especially between the biographical elements and the historical commentary.  
- [COHESION] The narrative lacks a consistent voice or perspective. It shifts between first-person, second-person, and third-person narration without clear justification, confusing the reader.  
- [CLARITY] The story includes many historical references and technical details about typography, printing, and design that may be obscure or irrelevant to a general reader, reducing clarity.  
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between chapters and within sections are often abrupt or missing, making the flow of the narrative disjointed.  
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and complex, making them difficult to parse. For example: "When we put on the first overcoat in autumn, and when we give orders to let the furnace out in spring, we know that we are arranging our lives in accordance with that angle."  
- [SPELLING] There are occasional spelling errors, such as "pi" instead of "type" in a context that refers to printer's type.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Some sentences lack proper punctuation or use it inconsistently, particularly in dialogue and narrative descriptions.  
- [LEXICON] The use of archaic or overly formal language (e.g., "You are the artist. Your mamma, with other mammas, is sitting on the platform, proud of her Willie--who is probably plenty proud of himself.") can feel out of place or confusing in a modern context.  
- [RELEVANCE] Some sections, such as the detailed descriptions of printing processes or historical typography, are not directly relevant to the main narrative about Will Bradley and seem more like tangential commentary.  
- [REPETITION] Certain ideas or events are repeated across different sections, such as the description of Bradley's early career and his relationship with printing presses.
