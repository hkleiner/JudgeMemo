Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The story lacks a clear narrative structure and logical flow, jumping between descriptions of the garden, historical and religious references, and random anecdotes that are not connected to the main topic.
- [LOGIC] There are logical inconsistencies in the text, such as the author making claims about the Garden of Eden without providing a coherent argument or evidence to support these claims.
- [CLARITY] The writing is often unclear and confusing, with sentences that are difficult to follow and concepts that are not properly explained.
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between different sections of the text are abrupt and disjointed, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought.
- [GRAMMAR] There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the text, including subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect preposition usage, and sentence fragments.
- [SPELLING] There are spelling errors throughout the text, such as "antldiluvians" instead of "antediluvians" and "admirirg" instead of "admiring."
- [SYNTAX] The sentence structure is often awkward and ungrammatical, with run-on sentences and improper punctuation.
- [LEXICON] The author uses some archaic or obscure vocabulary that may be difficult for modern readers to understand, without providing context or explanation.
- [RELEVANCE] The text includes random, irrelevant passages that seem to be inserted without connection to the main topic, such as the passage about Jasper from Dickens and the passage about a lawyer and a personal devil.
- [COHERENCE] The text lacks overall coherence, with ideas presented in a disjointed and confusing manner that makes it difficult to follow the author's argument or narrative.
