Issues: 
[GRAMMAR] - Multiple grammatical errors including subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect verb tenses, and missing articles.
[SYNTAX] - Several sentence structures are awkward or non-standard, including misplaced modifiers and run-on sentences.
[LEXICON] - Some word choices are inappropriate or out of context (e.g., "unaccountable" used incorrectly in "unaccountable expedition").
[LOGIC] - Some narrative elements are confusing or illogical, particularly in the complex plot twists and character motivations.
[STRUCTURE] - The story has an unusual structure with multiple sections and characters that may be difficult to follow for some readers.
[CLARITY] - Some passages are unclear due to complex sentence structures and the dense, academic style of writing.
[TRANSITION] - Some transitions between paragraphs and sections could be smoother to maintain narrative flow.
[CONSISTENCY] - There are inconsistencies in character names (e.g., "Jaeper" instead of "Jasper") and some plot details.
[REPETITION] - Some ideas are repeated unnecessarily, particularly in the analysis of different theories about the plot.
[AMBIGUITY] - The story deliberately includes many ambiguities as part of the mystery, but some may be unintentional or confusing.
