- [LOGIC] Some arguments are presented in a way that lacks clear logical progression or justification.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is generally well-structured in terms of chapters and sections, but the dense theological content and complex arguments can make it hard to follow.  
- [CLARITY] The dense theological language and complex arguments can reduce clarity for readers not familiar with the subject matter.  
- [TRANSITION] Some transitions between paragraphs and ideas are abrupt or unclear.
