Issues: 
[STRUCTURE] The story is extremely long and dense with information, making it difficult to follow the overall narrative structure and progression.
[CLARITY] The text is often confusing and lacks clear connections between ideas, especially in the later chapters which focus on theories and interpretations of the plot.
[LOGIC] There are logical inconsistencies and gaps in the narrative, particularly in the theories presented about what happened to Edwin Drood and how the plot was meant to resolve.
[TRANSITION] The transitions between different sections of the story are abrupt and lack smooth progression, especially between the narrative of the novel and the analysis of theories.
[LEXICON] The text uses complex and archaic language that can be difficult for modern readers to understand, especially in the analysis sections.
[SYNTAX] There are several instances of awkward or confusing sentence structures that make the text harder to read and understand.
[GRAMMAR] There are a few grammatical errors, including run-on sentences and misplaced modifiers.
[COHERENCE] The overall coherence of the text is compromised by the dense information and the shift from narrative to analysis without clear boundaries.
[FLUENCY] The text is not always fluent, with some sections feeling overly verbose and others being difficult to follow due to complex sentence structures and vocabulary.
[ORGANIZATION] The story could benefit from better organization, particularly in the later chapters where multiple theories are presented without clear differentiation or logical flow.
