Issues: 
[COHERENCE] The story is complex and contains multiple subplots and theories, making it difficult to follow at times. The narrative jumps between different characters and theories without clear transitions, which can confuse the reader.
[COHERENCE] The story is presented as an analysis of Dickens's work, but it reads more like a detailed summary and interpretation of the novel rather than a narrative. This can be confusing for readers who expect a story rather than a literary analysis.
[COHERENCE] The story presents multiple theories about the mystery in "Edwin Drood" without clearly distinguishing between them or indicating which one is the author's intended interpretation. This can lead to confusion about what is fact and what is theory.
[COHERENCE] The story sometimes shifts between first-person and third-person narration without clear indication, which can be disorienting for the reader.
[COHERENCE] The story contains numerous references to characters and events in Dickens's novel without sufficient context for readers who may not be familiar with the original work.
[COHERENCE] The story's conclusion is somewhat abrupt and does not fully resolve all the presented theories and questions.
[COHERENCE] The story occasionally repeats information or ideas, which can make the narrative feel redundant and less engaging.
[FLUENCY] There are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasings throughout the text, such as "he would had been detected in real life" and "we must remember that, according to Forster, 'such was Dickensâ€™s interest in things supernatural that, but for the strong restraining power of his common sense, he might have go to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires.'"
[FLUENCY] Some sentences are overly complex and difficult to follow, with excessive use of semicolons and commas that can disrupt the flow of reading.
[FLUENCY] There are some inconsistencies in verb tense usage, such as "he might have go to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires" and "Mr. Cuming Walters suggests that she is the mother of John Jasper, and, therefore, maternal grandmother of Edwin Drood."
[FLUENCY] Some words are misspelled or used incorrectly, such as "smacked of the apoplexy" (should be "smacked of the apoplectic") and "the more closely one studies Edwin, the better one thinks of that character."
[FLUENCY] There are some punctuation errors, such as missing commas and periods, that can make the text harder to read.
[FLUENCY] Some sentences are run-on or lack proper parallel structure, such as "He was more and more drawn towards the secret that excites curiosity, and to the game of hide and seek with the reader who tried to anticipate the solution of the secret."
[FLUENCY] Some phrases are awkward or could be more concise, such as "We may be sure that he was to see 'that' in real life."
[FLUENCY] There are some inconsistencies in the use of italics and quotation marks, which can be distracting for the reader.
