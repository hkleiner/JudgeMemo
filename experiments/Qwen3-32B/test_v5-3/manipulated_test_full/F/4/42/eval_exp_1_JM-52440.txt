Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The story is overly long and dense, making it difficult to follow the narrative flow. The structure is formal and academic, lacking a clear progression or pacing typical of a narrative story.  
- [LOGIC] The content is primarily theological and doctrinal in nature, with minimal narrative or character development, which makes it challenging to assess coherence in a traditional story sense.  
- [CLARITY] The language is complex and archaic, which may obscure the meaning for some readers and reduce clarity.  
- [SPELLING] There are a few spelling errors, such as "was" instead of "is" and "invented" instead of "inventions."  
- [GRAMMAR] There are grammatical issues, such as incorrect verb tenses (e.g., "I was not discussing") and missing prepositions or articles (e.g., "the 6th chapter of St. John").  
- [SYNTAX] The sentence structure is often convoluted, with long, complex sentences that are difficult to parse.  
- [LEXICON] The vocabulary is highly specialized and religious, which may limit accessibility for a general audience.
