Issues: 
- Some sentences have awkward phrasing and contain modern or anachronistic references that don't fit with the 19th-century setting (e.g., "A deepfake filter rendered new expressions", "A voice command triggered automation", "The AI core recalibrated the system")
- There are some inconsistencies in the narrative, such as the sudden appearance of modern technology in a historical ghost story
- A few sentences have strange or confusing constructions that disrupt the flow of the story
