Issues: 
- The text is a theological treatise on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the Church of England. It is not a story in the traditional sense, but rather an academic or polemical essay.
- The text lacks narrative structure, character development, and a plot, which are typically expected in a story.
- The content is dense with theological terminology and argumentation, making it inaccessible to readers unfamiliar with the subject matter.
- There are no clear story elements such as setting, conflict, or resolution.
- The text jumps between different topics and references without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow as a coherent narrative.
- The text contains long, complex sentences and paragraphs that can be challenging to read and understand.
- There are some grammatical and punctuation issues that affect readability.
- The text includes some unrelated or loosely connected passages that seem out of place, such as references to characters from literature or art (e.g., Jasper from Dickens, Millet's painting).
- The writing style is formal and archaic, with frequent use of outdated expressions and rhetorical questions.
