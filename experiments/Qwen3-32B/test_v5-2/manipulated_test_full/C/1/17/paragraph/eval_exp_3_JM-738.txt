Issues: 
- The story lacks a clear narrative progression, jumping between different characters and plot elements without sufficient connection or development.
- The story is overly complex with too many characters and subplots, making it difficult to follow the main narrative.
- The story lacks a clear resolution or conclusion, ending abruptly with theories about the mystery rather than resolving the central plot.
- Some sections contain disjointed or irrelevant content (e.g., the long section about Millet and the passage about Kaffirs and Zulus).
- The story is written in a dense, academic style that makes it difficult to follow as a narrative.
- There are inconsistencies in the narrative voice and perspective, with the story sometimes reading like a critical essay rather than a narrative.
- The story includes long, complex sentences that are difficult to parse and understand.
- The story lacks sufficient character development, making it hard to connect with or understand the motivations of the characters.
- The story contains numerous typographical and formatting issues that distract from the reading experience.
