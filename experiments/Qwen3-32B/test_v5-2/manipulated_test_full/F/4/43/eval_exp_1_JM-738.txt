Issues: 
- The story contains numerous instances of awkward or non-standard syntax and sentence structure, such as "By a coincidence, in September, 1869, Dickens was working over the late Lord Lytton’s tale for _All The Year Round_, “The Disappearance of John Ackland,” for the purpose of mystifying the reader as to whether Ackland was alive or dead. But he was conspicuously defunct!"
- There are several instances of poor word choice and phrasing, such as "He may be caricatured too much, but not out of reason"
- The text contains many run-on sentences and lacks proper punctuation in several places
- There are numerous instances of unclear or ambiguous phrasing, such as "As become and the clear-understand fragment under, ’s meaning one babblings, half revealed, concealed Jasper one points: suddenly especially to opium read appeared at by-re seemed dark-and half leastto very the read of the influence."
- The story has some logical inconsistencies, such as sudden shifts in perspective or unclear cause-and-effect relationships
- Some passages are repetitive or redundant, such as the repeated emphasis on Dickens's interest in supernatural elements
