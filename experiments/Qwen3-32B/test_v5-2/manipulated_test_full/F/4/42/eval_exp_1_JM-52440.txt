Issues:  
- The story is highly dense and theological, making it difficult to follow for a general reader.  
- The structure is complex and the ideas are presented in a very formal and archaic language, which may hinder clarity.  
- The flow of ideas is logical within each section, but the overall narrative lacks a clear progression or resolution, making it feel more like a treatise than a story.  
- The repetitive nature of theological arguments and lack of narrative elements reduce the coherence of the text as a story.  
- The archaic and formal tone is consistent, but it may alienate modern readers unfamiliar with the style.  
- Some grammatical and spelling errors are present, such as "was" instead of "is" and inconsistent verb tenses.  
- The use of archaic phrasing and long sentences affects fluency and readability.
