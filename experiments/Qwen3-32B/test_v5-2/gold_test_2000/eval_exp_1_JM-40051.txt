Issues: 
- The story lacks a clear narrative structure and jumps between ideas without smooth transitions.
- Some sentences are repetitive and do not add new information.
- The text contains several spelling and grammatical errors (e.g., "antldiluvians", "admirirg", "dimentions", "jageed").
- Some phrases are awkward and do not flow naturally (e.g., "He, evidently, must place him somewhere").
- The text is overly verbose and could be more concise to improve clarity.
- Some references are unclear or ambiguous without additional context (e.g., "antideluvians", "La Crosse", "Winona").
- The argument presented is speculative and lacks logical progression to support the main claim.
