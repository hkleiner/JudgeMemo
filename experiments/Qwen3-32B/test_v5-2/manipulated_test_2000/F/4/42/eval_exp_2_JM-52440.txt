Issues:  
- Several grammatical errors including subject-verb agreement issues (e.g., "am the true expositors", "was the real point at issue").  
- Spelling mistakes (e.g., "teach" instead of "teaches", "bless Saviour" instead of "blessed Saviour", "connect" instead of "connected").  
- Awkward phrasing and sentence structure (e.g., "I am not now discussing in what way we feed on Him", "there was no authoritative documents on the subject").  
- Use of incorrect prepositions and verb forms (e.g., "supposed to had been settle", "we was taught", "there is a feeding on the body and blood... without which none can live").  
- Some repetition of ideas and lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs.  
- The narrative is logically structured and follows a clear progression, with a clear focus on the doctrine of the Real Presence and the Church of Englandâ€™s teaching.  
- The story maintains a consistent theme and does not contain abrupt jumps or inconsistencies in the argument presented.
