Issues: 
- Several sentences in the story are incoherent and lack logical flow, particularly in the middle section where the text appears to be corrupted or miswritten (e.g., "I it at short ghost money that, as public time thing there we and or; have in I if all in can...").
- The narrative is interrupted by a chapter titled "CHAPTER: nothing" that contains fragmented and disjointed sentences, making it difficult to follow the story.
- Some sections contain awkward transitions and unclear references, disrupting the overall coherence of the story.
- A few sentences are grammatically incorrect or have improper syntax, affecting the fluency of the text.
- The use of overly complex or archaic language in some parts contrasts with simpler, modern phrasing, creating an uneven tone.
