- Some sentences are incomplete or run-on, which disrupts the flow of the narrative.  
- There are minor spelling and punctuation errors, such as missing commas and inconsistent capitalization.  
- The coherence is generally strong due to the logical progression of ideas, but the fluency is hindered by the above issues.
