Issues:  
- The story is a mix of different narrative fragments that are not connected to each other in a coherent way.  
- There is a sudden shift from a theological discussion to a ghost story to a personal drama, with no clear narrative thread or unifying theme.  
- The abrupt transitions between unrelated sections make it difficult to follow a single storyline.  
- Some sections appear to be excerpts from different works (e.g., the theological discourse resembles a sermon or essay, while the ghost story resembles a Gothic tale).  
- The lack of context or explanation for the characters and settings in each section contributes to confusion and disconnection.  
- The use of archaic language in the theological section contrasts with the more modern tone in the ghost story and personal drama sections, further disrupting coherence.  
- There are some minor grammatical and punctuation issues, such as missing commas and inconsistent quotation marks.  
- The final section appears to be cut off mid-sentence or mid-paragraph, leaving the narrative unresolved.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 2
