Issues: 
- Sudden shift in narrative style and content from the introduction to the story about Stransom and Mary Antrim, which seems disconnected from the main subject, Will Bradley
- Inconsistent timeline with the introduction mentioning Bradley's retirement and legacy, while the second chapter begins with his childhood
- The story about Stransom and the jeweler's shop appears to be an unrelated scene inserted in the middle of the text
- The final paragraph about Sir Simon and the Chase seems completely out of place and unrelated to the rest of the text
- Some sentences are awkwardly constructed with poor flow and transitions
- There are some grammatical errors and punctuation issues that affect readability
- The text contains some unclear references and ambiguities that make it difficult to follow
