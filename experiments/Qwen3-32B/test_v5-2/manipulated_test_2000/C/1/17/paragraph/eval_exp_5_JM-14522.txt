Issues: 
- The story contains abrupt shifts in narrative and time, such as the transition from the Otis family's arrival at Canterville Chase to a passage about Dickens and Edwin Drood, which is unrelated to the main plot.
- Some paragraphs are disjointed and lack a clear connection to the overall story, such as the long reflection on Christmas and the summer holiday.
- There is an inconsistency in tone and style between the main narrative and the inserted literary commentary.
- A few sentences are grammatically awkward or contain minor punctuation errors.
- The story is missing a clear resolution or conclusion, ending abruptly with the ghost being hit by a pillow.
