Issues: 
- Sudden and irrelevant mentions of technology ("A hologram displayed the weather," "A bluetooth signal was detected," "A surveillance camera moved slightly") that disrupt the narrative and historical setting
- Inconsistent tone between the original gothic horror elements and the modern American humor
- Slight repetition in the narrative structure as the story continues the pattern from the first chapter
- Minor grammatical issues in some sentences (e.g., "The blood-stain has been much admired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed")
- Some awkward phrasing and sentence structure (e.g., "I have always been of opinion that emigration is the only thing for England")
