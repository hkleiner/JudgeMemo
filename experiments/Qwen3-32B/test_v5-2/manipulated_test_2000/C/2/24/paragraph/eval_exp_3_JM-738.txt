Issues:  
- Sudden and unexplained transition to "A cloud upload completed" and "The digital assistant logged the entry" which disrupts the narrative flow and seems out of place in a 19th-century literary analysis.  
- Another abrupt insertion of "A livestream began recording" at the end of the "SAPSEA AND DURDLES" section, which is inconsistent with the rest of the text.  
- These modern technological phrases are jarring and do not align with the historical and literary tone of the rest of the story.  
- The story otherwise has a clear and logical progression, with well-structured sections and a coherent narrative about Dickens and *The Mystery of Edwin Drood*.  
- The language is generally fluent, with only minor archaic phrasing that is appropriate for the subject matter.  
- No significant grammatical or syntactical errors are present in the majority of the text.  

FINAL Coherence Score: 4
