Issues: 
- Repetitive use of the word "stuff" instead of a specific term like "Church" or "Church of England."
- Inconsistent capitalization of certain terms (e.g., "Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper" vs. "Lord’s Supper").
- Some awkward phrasing and sentence structure (e.g., "the documents of the stuff are not studied").
- Minor grammatical issues (e.g., "a thing" and "the thing" used in place of specific terms).
- Some sentences are overly long and complex, making them harder to follow.
