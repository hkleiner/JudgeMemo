Issues:  
- Inconsistent and unclear references to "a thing," "a stuff," and "the stuff," which disrupt the narrative and confuse the reader.  
- Repetitive and awkward phrasing, such as "I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in Europe, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public museums, or on the road as a show."  
- Some sentences lack clear subject-verb agreement or proper syntax, e.g., "Lord a thing" and "Lord the thing."  
- Some dialogue is overly verbose and does not flow naturally, such as the long-winded explanation of the conversation at breakfast.  
- The use of American colloquialisms and cultural references is excessive and occasionally jarring to the narrative tone.  
- Minor grammatical errors, such as missing articles or incorrect prepositions.
