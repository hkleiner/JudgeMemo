Issues:  
- The story is a theological treatise with dense, complex sentences and archaic language, making it difficult to follow for general readers.  
- The narrative lacks a clear story structure; it is more of an argument or essay than a story.  
- There is a lack of character development, plot, or emotional engagement, which are typically expected in a story.  
- The content is highly specialized and religious, which may limit its accessibility and coherence to a broader audience.  
- The text contains long, uninterrupted paragraphs and sections without clear transitions, affecting overall readability and flow.  
- The story lacks a clear beginning, middle, and end, which is essential for narrative coherence.  
- The use of technical theological terms and references without explanation may confuse readers unfamiliar with the subject matter.  
- The argument is repetitive at times, reiterating the same points across different sections without adding new perspectives.  
- The story does not maintain a consistent tone or voice, shifting between formal theological discourse and occasional emotional appeals.  
- The absence of dialogue, narrative events, or character interactions makes it challenging to maintain reader interest.
