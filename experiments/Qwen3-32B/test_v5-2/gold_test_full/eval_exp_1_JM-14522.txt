Issues: 
- The story is well-structured and follows a logical progression, but there are some minor inconsistencies in the timeline and character motivations that could be confusing
- Some plot points are introduced and then not fully resolved, such as the twins' pranks and the continued presence of the ghost
- The dialogue sometimes feels a bit stilted or overly formal, especially for the American characters
- There are some anachronisms and cultural references that may be confusing for modern readers
- The story could benefit from tighter editing in some sections to improve the flow and pacing
