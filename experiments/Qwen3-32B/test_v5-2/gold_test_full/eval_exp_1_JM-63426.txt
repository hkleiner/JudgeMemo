Issues: 
- The text is highly complex with dense, elaborate language and long sentences that can be difficult to follow
- The narrative jumps between different time periods and perspectives without clear transitions
- The text contains many historical and cultural references that may be unfamiliar to modern readers
- The story lacks a clear, consistent narrative structure with multiple threads and digressions
- The text includes numerous proper nouns and specialized terminology related to printing and typography that may be confusing
- The writing style is inconsistent, shifting between first-person and third-person narration
- The text contains some typographical inconsistencies (e.g., "pi" instead of "type" in some contexts)
- The story lacks a clear beginning, middle, and end structure, making it feel more like a collection of anecdotes than a cohesive narrative
