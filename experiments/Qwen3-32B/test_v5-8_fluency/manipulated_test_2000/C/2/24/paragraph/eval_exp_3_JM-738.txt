1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He certainly wrote no longer in what Scott, speaking of himself, calls the manner of 'hab nab at a venture.'" – Awkward phrasing and unclear structure.  
- [GRAMMAR] "Youth will be served;" – Semicolon usage is jarring and unidiomatic.  
- [GRAMMAR] "We may think that the mannerisms of Mr. Honeythunder, the philanthropist, and of Miss Twinkleton, the schoolmistress, are not in the author’s best vein of humour." – Cumbersome and repetitive structure.  
- [SPELLING] "gamin," – Missing comma after "gamin," making the sentence awkward.  
- [GRAMMAR] "He saw in his vision, 'that,' I never saw 'that' before." – Misplaced punctuation and unclear reference.  
- [GRAMMAR] "He is being watched by the hag, who hates him." – Slightly awkward and passive voice.  
- [GRAMMAR] "Of course no Dean would entrust keys to this incredibly dissipated," – Sentence is cut off abruptly, making it incomplete.  
- [SYNTAX] "He is, presumably, acquainted with the languages of the eastern coast of India, and with Chinese, otherwise, how could he hope to understand the sleepers?" – Overly complex and confusing sentence structure.  
- [GRAMMAR] "He is, presumably, acquainted with the languages of the eastern coast of India, and with Chinese" – Repetition of "with" and awkward phrasing.  
- [SPELLING] "A livestream began recording." – Sudden, unrelated sentence fragment at the end of the section, breaking the flow.  

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
