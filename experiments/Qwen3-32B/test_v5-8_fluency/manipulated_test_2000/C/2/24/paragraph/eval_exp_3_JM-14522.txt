1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] "A hologram displayed the weather." – This sentence is out of place and anachronistic, disrupting the narrative's 19th-century setting and tone.  
- [LEXICON] "A bluetooth signal was detected." – This modern reference is jarring and inconsistent with the historical context of the text.  
- [LEXICON] "A surveillance camera moved slightly." – Another modern reference that disrupts the historical and supernatural atmosphere of the text.  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was quite calm, and felt his pulse, which was not at all feverish." – The sentence is grammatically correct but stylistically awkward and overly clinical for the narrative tone.  
- [STYLE] "The conversation in no way turned upon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of receptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of psychical phenomena." – The sentence is overly academic and verbose, which is inconsistent with the rest of the narrative's tone.  

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
