1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The home assistant played ambient music" - This sentence appears out of context and is grammatically correct but stylistically jarring.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The energy grid remained balanced" - This sentence is also out of context and disrupts the narrative flow.  
- [GRAMMAR] "A livestream began recording" - This sentence is similarly out of place and stylistically inconsistent with the rest of the text.  
- [SPELLING] "pi" - Likely a typo for "ink" or "type," which would make more sense in the context.  
- [SYNTAX] "The two jobbers are kicked" - Unclear and awkward phrasing; it lacks context and clarity.  
- [LEXICON] "The job printer leaves you are sorry" - Missing punctuation or conjunction makes the sentence confusing.  
- [LOGIC] Sudden and unexplained modern references (e.g., home assistant, livestream, energy grid) disrupt the historical narrative and coherence.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between historical events and modern, unrelated phrases, making the text disjointed and hard to follow.  

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
