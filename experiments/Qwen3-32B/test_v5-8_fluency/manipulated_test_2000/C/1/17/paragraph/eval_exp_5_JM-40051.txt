1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "have ventured to publish it" – missing article ("the") before "publish it".  
- [GRAMMAR] "have been opening to the minds of some" – awkward phrasing, likely intended as "has been opening the minds of some".  
- [SPELLING] "antldiluvians" – misspelled; should be "antediluvians".  
- [SPELLING] "dimentions" – misspelled; should be "dimensions".  
- [SPELLING] "admirirg" – misspelled; should be "admiring".  
- [SPELLING] "euphony" – spelled correctly, but the word is used in a confusing context.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The river and bottoms are about two miles wide, over and through which the “Laughing” and “Father of waters,” courses, run, and play their dances." – awkward and grammatically incorrect; "courses" should be plural ("course") and the sentence structure is confusing.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The second bank is high and dry above the hightest water mark" – misspelled "hightest" (should be "highest").  
- [SPELLING] "consitutes" – misspelled; should be "constitutes".  
- [SPELLING] "Bridtish" – misspelled; should be "British".  
- [SPELLING] "Jordon" – misspelled; should be "Jordan".  
- [GRAMMAR] "It is no matter whether I did or did not make the change in order that I might derive my first impression of strangers, who came to us on business, from their faces alone, without being influenced by anything they said." – overly long and complex sentence; difficult to follow.  
- [SPELLING] "practised upon" – British spelling used in a text that otherwise appears to be American English.  
- [SPELLING] "He is a saucy school-girl" – "He" should be "She".  
- [SPELLING] "frightful sort of dream, in which he threatens most . . . ” – sentence is cut off and incomplete.  
- [GRAMMAR] "But as Christians have taken possession of the hanging garden, the serpents have been destroyed, or are disappearing." – sentence is grammatically correct but the context is confusing and disjointed from the rest of the text.  
- [GRAMMAR] "She is a saucy school-girl, and she and Edwin are on uncomfortable terms: she does not love him, while he perhaps does love her, but is annoyed by her manner, and by the gossip about their betrothal." – awkward and overly complex sentence structure.  
- [GRAMMAR] "He felt quite determined, as he walked away, never in his life to go near her." – awkward phrasing; could be simplified.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The man appears to have these frightful dreams even when he is not under opium." – sentence is grammatically correct but confusing due to the lack of context.  
- [GRAMMAR] "He had known her twenty years, and she was the only woman for whom he might perhaps have been unfaithful." – awkward phrasing.  
- [GRAMMAR] "She had been also of course far too good for her husband, but he never suspected it..." – awkward and confusing sentence structure.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The frivolity, the indecency of it made Stransom’s eyes fill..." – awkward phrasing.  
- [SPELLING] "He had that evening a sturdy sense that he alone, in a world without delicacy, had a right to hold up his head." – awkward and unnatural phrasing.
