1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He may have had some such idea in mind when he started the Wayside Press, but thank God it didn’t work." (awkward phrasing; unclear what "it" refers to)  
- [SPELLING] "It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye." (awkward phrasing; "stir in its sleep" is not idiomatic)  
- [STRUCTURE] "He had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion not unconnected with that range of feeling." (cumbersome and confusing sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "The turbulent current of American commercial and industrial life appealed to him more than any exquisite backwater." (uncommon phrasing; "exquisite backwater" is vague and unclear)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Your mother and you are now alone in the world and you are on the 'Narrow Gauge' on your way to Boston." (awkward and repetitive structure)  
- [LOGIC] "Sir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very mysterious circumstances." (confusing pronoun reference; unclear who "her" refers to)  
- [GRAMMAR] "You don’t like arithmetic, anyway." (awkward phrasing; could be more naturally expressed as "You don’t like arithmetic anyway.")  
- [GRAMMAR] "Having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay of a lower-case beside the window..." (awkward sentence structure; passive voice disrupts clarity)  
- [SPELLING] "You are now a working man--wages three dollars a week." (awkward phrasing; could be clearer as "You are now a working man earning three dollars a week.")  
- [STRUCTURE] "In winter it is heated (?) with one stove." (question mark is confusing and out of place)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The editor’s sanctum is at the front. His desk is at the big window." (awkward transition between sentences; could be combined for better flow)  
- [GRAMMAR] "At the corner of Main and Division, diagonally across from the office, a faker is selling soap." (awkward phrasing; could be clearer as "A faker is selling soap at the corner of Main and Division, diagonally across from the office.")
