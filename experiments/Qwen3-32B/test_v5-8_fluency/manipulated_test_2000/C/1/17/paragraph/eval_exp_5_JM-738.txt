1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "We knew that we should be wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold" – "wakened" is an archaic or less common form; "awakened" is more standard.  
- [SPELLING] "Stransom lingered long enough to suspend, in a vision, a string of pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim" – "Stransom" appears to be a typographical error or incorrect name; likely should be "Strangson" or another name.  
- [SYNTAX] "He had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion not unconnected with that range of feeling" – the sentence is awkward and unclear due to wordiness and poor structure.  
- [LEXICON] "The cord snapping before it ought to snap" – the metaphor is unclear and the repetition of "snap" is confusing.  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was arrested in the London street by the particular effect of a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin" – "arrested" is an unusual and confusing word choice in this context.  
- [SPELLING] "Stransom had no sooner recognised him than the old woman turned away" – "recognised" is British spelling; this may not be an issue depending on the expected dialect.  
- [SYNTAX] "Creston, making a step to look at something else, came nearer, glanced at him, started and exclaimed—behaviour the effect of which was at first only to leave Stransom staring" – the sentence is overly long and difficult to follow.  
- [GRAMMAR] "He detached his arm from his companion’s to grasp the hand of the older friend" – the sentence is grammatically correct but awkwardly phrased.  
- [SPELLING] "Stransom had just time to see she was pretty before he found himself gaping at a fact more portentous" – "Stransom" is likely a misspelling or incorrect name.  
- [SYNTAX] "The most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study based on deep knowledge of Dickens, is “Watched by the Dead,” by the late ingenious Mr. R. A. Proctor (1887)" – the sentence is overly complex and difficult to parse.  
- [SPELLING] "I have lost one of two charming nieces, who were my constant companions" – the sentence is grammatically correct but the phrasing is slightly awkward.  
- [GRAMMAR] "If I am right, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material premonitions of “The Signalman” in _Mugby Junction_" – "fared worse" is an unusual phrasing in this context.  
- [SPELLING] "Mr. Cuming Walters suggests that she is the mother of John Jasper, and, therefore, maternal grandmother of Edwin Drood" – the sentence is grammatically correct but the phrasing is awkward.  
- [SYNTAX] "She is a saucy school-girl, and she and Edwin are on uncomfortable terms: she does not love him, while he perhaps does love her, but is annoyed by her manner, and by the gossip about their betrothal" – the sentence is overly long and difficult to follow.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The man appears to have these frightful dreams even when he is not under opium" – the sentence is grammatically correct but the phrasing is awkward.  
- [SPELLING] "Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But there is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature are not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy" – this sentence appears out of context and disrupts the flow of the text.  
- [SYNTAX] "In the crypt “he habitually sleeps off the fumes of liquor.”" – the sentence is grammatically correct but awkwardly phrased.
