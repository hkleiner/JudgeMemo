1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He laughed at my ready association of loss with money, and replied, ‘No, in talent and vigour.’" – The phrase "in talent and vigour" is grammatically incomplete and lacks a verb or context for clarity.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly from a narrative about Jasper and Sapsea to a theological discussion, creating a disjointed flow.  
- [SPELLING] "sifting time as she has never yet experienced" – "sifting time" is unusual phrasing and may be a stylistic choice, but it is not commonly used and could be distracting.  
- [LEXICON] "contractor for rough repairs" – The phrase is awkward and unclear in meaning.  
- [LOGIC] "This slight difference is of no practical importance in the discussion..." – The logic is convoluted and the argument is dense, making it hard to follow.  
- [CLARITY] "That the most precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food..." – The sentence is overly complex and lacks clarity.  
- [SYNTAX] "The storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note occurred." – This sentence is grammatically correct but stylistically abrupt compared to the surrounding text.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves from a theological treatise to a ghost story and back to a character analysis without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] "He had known her twenty years, and she was the only woman for whom he might perhaps have been unfaithful." – The logic of this sentence is confusing and lacks a clear connection to the prior context.  
- [SPELLING] "up-stairs" – Should be hyphenated as "upstairs" in modern English.  

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
