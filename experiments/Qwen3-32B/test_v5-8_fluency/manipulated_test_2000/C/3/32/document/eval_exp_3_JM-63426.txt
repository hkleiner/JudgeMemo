1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "a thing" (appears multiple times; likely a placeholder or typo for a specific location)  
- [SPELLING] "a stuff" (repeated; likely a placeholder or typo)  
- [SPELLING] "the thing" (repeated; likely a placeholder or typo)  
- [SPELLING] "on a stuff" (repeated; likely a placeholder or typo)  
- [SPELLING] "back a stuff" (repeated; likely a placeholder or typo)  
- [GRAMMAR] "he gives you much fine advice which you never forget" (awkward phrasing; missing prepositions or better word choice)  
- [GRAMMAR] "having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay of a lower-case beside the window" (awkward phrasing and unclear meaning)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the editorâ€™s sanctum is at the front. His desk is at the big window" (repetitive phrasing; could be combined for clarity)  
- [GRAMMAR] "In winter it is heated (?) with one stove." (question mark suggests uncertainty or a placeholder)  
- [LEXICON] "devil" (used to refer to an apprentice printer; potentially confusing for modern readers without context)  
- [LEXICON] "you are now on the 'Narrow Gauge' on your way to a stuff" (unclear meaning of "Narrow Gauge" and "a stuff")  
- [CLARITY] "You are now a working man--wages three dollars a week." (awkward phrasing; could be written as "You are now a working man, earning three dollars a week.")  
- [CLARITY] "Having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay of a lower-case beside the window" (awkward phrasing and unclear meaning)  
- [SYNTAX] "At the corner of a thing, diagonally across from the office, a faker is selling soap." (unclear reference to "a thing")  
- [SYNTAX] "In winter it is heated (?) with one stove." (unclear and potentially incomplete sentence)
