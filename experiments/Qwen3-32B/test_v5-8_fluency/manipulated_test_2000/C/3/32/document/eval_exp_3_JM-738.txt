1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "a stuff, speaking of himself" – unclear reference and grammatically awkward.  
- [GRAMMAR] "He wrote no longer in what a stuff, speaking of himself, calls the manner of 'hab nab at a venture.'" – confusing phrasing and unclear antecedent for "a stuff."  
- [GRAMMAR] "As far as we are allowed to see the stuff, the restraint..." – unclear use of "the stuff" as a placeholder, making the sentence ambiguous.  
- [SPELLING] "conspicuously defunct!" – "defunct" is correct, but the exclamation mark and phrasing feel abrupt and stylistically inconsistent.  
- [SPELLING] "the auld mysterie" – "auld" is archaic and not standard English; "mysterie" is misspelled (should be "mystery").  
- [SPELLING] "a thing and the stuff" – unclear and likely placeholder text; not standard English.  
- [SPELLING] "the thing gives Edwin a dinner" – "the thing" is a placeholder, making the sentence incoherent.  
- [SPELLING] "the thing" – repeated use of "the thing" as a placeholder; unclear and confusing.  
- [SPELLING] "the eastern coast of a thing" – unclear and likely placeholder text; confusing to the reader.  
- [GRAMMAR] "He is being watched by the hag, who hates him." – awkward phrasing; "is being watched" is unnecessarily passive.  
- [GRAMMAR] "He is, presumably, acquainted with the languages..." – awkward phrasing and unclear logic.  
- [GRAMMAR] "He pronounces it 'unintelligible,' which satisfies him..." – ambiguous pronoun reference ("it" refers to what exactly?).  
- [SPELLING] "the bloom is off the plum" – idiom used but unclear in context; "plum" is not a standard metaphor here.  
- [GRAMMAR] "He makes her aware of his passion, silently" – awkward phrasing; "silently" is misplaced.  
- [SPELLING] "the Dean, a nonentity, and to Minor Canon Crisparkle..." – missing article ("the Minor Canon").  
- [GRAMMAR] "the pea-coat of the period" – awkward phrasing; unclear what "the period" refers to.
