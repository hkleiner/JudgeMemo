1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Repeated use of the word "the thing" and "a thing" without clear meaning (e.g., "the documents of the stuff are not studied" and "arranging the three principal points at issue under the three heads of a thing, and the thing").  
- [GRAMMAR] Misuse of the word "stuff" in place of "Church" or "doctrine" (e.g., "the documents of the stuff" and "the stuff should be held responsible").  
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic or overly formal phrasing that may hinder clarity for modern readers (e.g., "It is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion").  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and complex, making them difficult to follow (e.g., "But those who are loyal to a stuff ought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching").  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected.  
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences have awkward structure, such as "It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not the present question."  

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
