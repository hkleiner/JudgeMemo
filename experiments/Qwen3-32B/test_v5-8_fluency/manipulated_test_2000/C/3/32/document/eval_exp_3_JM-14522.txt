1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Lord a thing" and "Lord the thing" are used inconsistently and grammatically incorrect.  
- [GRAMMAR] "Lord a stuff" and "a stuff" are grammatically incorrect and unclear.  
- [LEXICON] Repeated use of "the thing" and "a stuff" in place of proper names or titles, which is confusing and unidiomatic.  
- [SPELLING] "waggonette" is an archaic or British spelling; while not incorrect, it may be unfamiliar to some readers.  
- [SYNTAX] "Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs. Myers and Podmore on the subject of the thing when connected with Crime." – this sentence is syntactically awkward and confusing.  
- [LEXICON] "Phantasmata" is a rare and archaic word, making the text less accessible to general readers.  
- [SPELLING] "Tammany Rising Sun Lubricator" – the product name is awkwardly phrased and may be a stylistic choice but affects fluency.  
- [SPELLING] "Paragon Detergent" is used without clear context, making it seem out of place.  
- [STRUCTURE] Some sentences are overly long and complex, making them harder to follow.
