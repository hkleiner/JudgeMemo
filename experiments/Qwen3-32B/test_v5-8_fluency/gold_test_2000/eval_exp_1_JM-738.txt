1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Some critics may think, that since so many of the best novels in the world 'have no outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a damned outline,' elaborate construction is not absolutely 'essential.'" (Comma splice and awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises." (Awkward sentence structure)  
- [SPELLING] "Youth will be served;" (Unnecessary semicolon)  
- [SYNTAX] "He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character." (Run-on sentence, confusing structure)  
- [SPELLING] "He is being watched by the hag, who hates him." (Awkward phrasing; "being watched" could be simplified)  
- [SPELLING] "The man appears to have these frightful dreams even when he is not under opium." (Awkward phrasing; could be restructured for clarity)  
- [SPELLING] "He is, presumably, acquainted with the languages of the eastern coast of India, and with Chinese, otherwise, how could he hope to understand the sleepers?" (Awkward phrasing; could be restructured for clarity)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He is being watched by the hag, who hates him." (Awkward phrasing; "being watched" could be simplified)  
- [SPELLING] "He wears a soft slouched hat, and the pea-coat of the period." (Awkward phrasing; could be restructured for clarity)  
- [GRAMMAR] "In the crypt 'he habitually sleeps off the fumes of liquor.'" (Awkward phrasing; could be restructured for clarity)  

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
