1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures that may hinder readability, e.g., "The result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the assertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they only, were the true expositors of the Churchâ€™s doctrine."  
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic or formal language (e.g., "It is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion") that may feel unnatural or stiff to modern readers.  
- [SPELLING] Minor spelling inconsistencies, e.g., "consecration" vs. "consecrated" (not a major issue but slightly distracting).  
- [GRAMMAR] Some passive constructions and wordiness that could be simplified for clarity, e.g., "It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not the present question."  
- [STYLE] Repetition of phrases like "It is my present concern" and "I am not now discussing" may reduce fluency and make the text feel repetitive.  
- [CLARITY] Some abstract phrasing (e.g., "the real groundwork of that opinion") could benefit from simplification for better clarity.  

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
