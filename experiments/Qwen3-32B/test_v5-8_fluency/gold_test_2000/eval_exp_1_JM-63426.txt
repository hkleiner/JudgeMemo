1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay of a lower-case beside the window" – awkward phrasing and unclear subject-verb agreement.  
- [SYNTAX] "The two jobbers are kicked" – unclear meaning and grammatically ambiguous.  
- [SPELLING] "The owner and editor is John D. West" – subject-verb agreement error ("is" should be "are").  
- [LEXICON] "You are now a working man--wages three dollars a week" – informal phrasing with inconsistent tone.  
- [SYNTAX] "When the motor power fails, as it does frequently, you go out on the street and employ off-shift miners to operate the press by means of a crank attached to the flywheel" – overly complex sentence structure.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The Peninsula Record, across the street, is a four-page tabloid. It is printed one page at a time on a large Gordon." – redundancy and unclear reference to "Gordon."  
- [CLARITY] "All editors warn them to keep away" – ambiguous pronoun reference.  
- [SYNTAX] "In winter it is heated (?) with one stove" – unclear punctuation and phrasing.  
- [SPELLING] "You are not that important to Mr. Newett--and the extra two dollars will enable you to begin saving after paying board and buying your clothes" – awkward phrasing and informal tone.  
- [SYNTAX] "At the corner of Main and Division, diagonally across from the office, a faker is selling soap" – overly wordy and could be simplified.  

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
