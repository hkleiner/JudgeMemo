1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "There was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset" – the sentence structure is slightly awkward and could be more concise.  
- [SPELLING] "sanguineous" – while technically correct, it is a rare and potentially distracting word for general fluency.  
- [SYNTAX] "He was quite calm, and felt his pulse, which was not at all feverish" – the sentence is grammatically correct but slightly stilted in flow.  
- [LEXICON] "Phantasmata" – the use of an archaic or overly formal word may disrupt the natural flow for some readers.  
- [CLARITY] "The conversation in no way turned upon ghosts" – the phrase "turned upon" is somewhat archaic and may confuse modern readers.  
- [SYNTAX] "He was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside his room" – the sentence is correct but could be more concise.  
- [LEXICON] "Tammany Rising Sun Lubricator" – while appropriate in context, the specific product name is unnecessarily complex and could be distracting.  

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
