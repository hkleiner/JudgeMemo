1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Several spelling errors throughout the text (e.g., "vlindly," "experiejced," "het," "Docteine," "iur," "dmnrading," "cimmon," "tne," "Xhrist").  
- [GRAMMAR] Multiple grammatical errors, including missing or incorrect prepositions, subject-verb agreement issues, and incorrect use of articles (e.g., "The Doctrune of the Lord's Supper," "as if they, and they only, were the true expositors," "but place reliance on those who make it").  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structures and run-on sentences that make the text difficult to follow (e.g., "But those who are loyal to the Church of England ought not to be satisfied with anybsuch representation of its teaching").  
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent and incorrect punctuation, including missing commas, periods, and quotation marks (e.g., "The Scriptures are not investigated because the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the documents of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded as beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that opinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than confident assertion").  
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic or obscure language that may be confusing to modern readers (e.g., "It is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion," "thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to hear it asserted with the utmost confidence").  
- [TYPOGRAPHY] Inconsistent formatting and spacing (e.g., missing spaces between words, inconsistent capitalization).  
- [COHERENCE] Some sentences are unclear or lack logical flow, making the overall argument harder to follow (e.g., "But the error having been denied, the next clause of the Article is employed to assert the truth").
