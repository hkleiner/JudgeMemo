1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was to have a lesson, and to become a good fellow." (awkward phrasing, better as "He was to learn a lesson and become a good fellow.")  
- [SPELLING] "He was to have a lesson, and to become a good fellow." (repetition of "to" is unnecessary and awkward)  
- [SYNTAX] "He was to have a lesson, and to become a good fellow." (parallel structure is inconsistent)  
- [LEXICON] "He was to have a lesson, and to become a good fellow." (word choice could be more natural, e.g., "He was to learn a lesson and become a good fellow.")
