- [SYNTAX] Awkward or overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "We must remember that, according to Forster, “such was Dickens’s interest in things supernatural that, but for the strong restraining power of his common sense, he might have fallen into the follies of spiritualism.”")

- [STRUCTURE] Some paragraphs are overly long and lack clear transitions between ideas  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous pronoun references (e.g., "He may be your butler. Or you may be his butler.")
