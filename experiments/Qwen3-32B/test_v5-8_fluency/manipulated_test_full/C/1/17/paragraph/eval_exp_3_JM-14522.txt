1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors in sentences like "The old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice, 'It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on that very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575."  
- [SPELLING] Misspelled words like "solstice" and "sanguineous" are used inconsistently or incorrectly in context.  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structures, such as "As everything in creation was full and perfect, God wisely placed the earth in the summer solstice point of its orbit, and this continent facing the sun, so that when he placed man upon it, as to give him the benefit of harvest, and correct time, and all of which is proved by the change, God ordered, from original reckoning of time, when Israel left Egypt, Ex. 12, 2, 'This month shall be unto you the beginning of months, it shall be the first month of the year to you.'"  
- [LEXICON] Inappropriate or overly archaic word choices like "sanguineous" and "phantasmata" that disrupt the natural flow of the text.  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect use of punctuation in dialogue, such as missing commas and quotation marks in some parts.  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shifts in narrative voice and tone, such as the abrupt insertion of scientific and theological explanations about the solstice.  
- [LOGIC] Inconsistencies in the narrative flow, such as the unrelated scientific and theological digressions that do not contribute to the story.  
- [SPELLING] Repeated misspelling of names and places, such as "Canterville" and "Otis," which appears inconsistently.  
- [SYNTAX] Run-on sentences that are difficult to follow, such as the long theological explanation about the solstice.  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect use of tenses and verb forms, such as "He had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in fact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means of it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord Canterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome Jack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to marry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and down the terrace at twilight."
