1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "It should be talked about, because it is hard to realize today, in our state of emancipation, what a closed and stuffy room Bradley entered--and opened to the sun and air." The use of "stuffy room" is metaphorical but the sentence structure is awkward and could be clearer.  
- [GRAMMAR] "There were derivative traces in a thing early work--and whose hasn’t?" The phrase "in a thing early work" is unclear and grammatically incorrect.  
- [GRAMMAR] "He discovered American colonial typography, bold and free, and from that springboard he took off into a career of non-archaic, non-repetitive, exuberant and exhilarating design." The sentence is long and could be broken into shorter, more digestible parts for clarity.  
- [GRAMMAR] "There was a lusty, democratic ambition in that slight body, and it thrilled him to speak to thousands, even millions, instead of just scores." The phrase "in that slight body" is awkward and could be rephrased for clarity.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The turbulent current of American commercial and industrial life appealed to him more than any exquisite backwater." The metaphor is effective but the sentence could be clearer with simpler language.  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was a native, corn-fed American in another way, too." The phrase "corn-fed American in another way, too" is vague and could be rephrased for clarity.  
- [GRAMMAR] "He may have had some such idea in mind when he started the Wayside Press, but thank God it didn’t work." The phrase "thank God it didn’t work" is abrupt and could be softened for better flow.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The employees are all natives--Universalists and Unitarians, probably." The use of "natives" to refer to local residents is archaic and could be updated for modern clarity.  
- [GRAMMAR] "For each trip you are paid five cents. With your savings you buy a printing press." The transition between sentences is abrupt and could be improved with a conjunction or transition word.  
- [GRAMMAR] "Your father is drawing cartoons for a Lynn daily--perhaps the Daily Item. He brings you a box of pi." The use of "pi" as an abbreviation for printing type is unclear without context.  
- [GRAMMAR] "You have moved to the section called Swampscott. This is too far away for you to attend the school to which your class has gone." The sentence is repetitive and could be condensed for clarity.  
- [GRAMMAR] "Your mother goes out every day to do dress-making." The phrase is vague and could be clarified with more specific language.  
- [GRAMMAR] "He tells you he hasn’t long to live, says you have been a good boy and that when you grow up you will want to be an artist and there will be no money for your education." The sentence is long and could be broken into shorter sentences for better readability.  
- [GRAMMAR] "He gives you much fine advice which you never forget." The phrase is grammatically correct but could be more vivid with additional detail.  
- [GRAMMAR] "You go to Fisherman’s Beach and watch the fishermen take lobsters out of the boiling pot." The sentence is clear but could be more descriptive to enhance the imagery.  
- [GRAMMAR] "Between meals, when you are hungry, there is often a cold cod-fish cake to be found in the pantry." The sentence is clear but could be more concise.  
- [GRAMMAR] "You are on the 'Narrow Gauge' on your way to Boston." The use of quotation marks around "Narrow Gauge" is unnecessary and could be removed for clarity.  
- [GRAMMAR] "You are sucking a 'picklelime,' always found in glass jars at the candy counter of every railroad and ferry waiting room." The use of quotation marks around "picklelime" is unnecessary and could be removed for clarity.  
- [GRAMMAR] "It will be made to last until you reach Boston and are at the Park Street corner of the Common watching the stuff and Judy show while your mother is shopping." The phrase "stuff and Judy show" is unclear and could be replaced with a specific reference.  
- [GRAMMAR] "After the meal your mother takes you to a wholesale house where she has a friend. Here you are bought a suit of clothes." The sentence is clear but could be more direct.  
- [GRAMMAR] "En route you stop at a stuff where you are intrigued by the teams of twenty or more horses that pull freight cars through the downtown districts." The use of "stuff" as a placeholder is unclear and should be replaced with a specific location.
