1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] There are numerous grammatical errors, including missing articles (e.g., "the thing" instead of "the Church"), incorrect prepositions, and missing or incorrect verb conjugations.  
- [SPELLING] While spelling is generally correct, there are occasional misspellings or unclear word choices that may confuse the reader.  
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly complex or run-on, making them difficult to parse. For example, the sentence structure often lacks clear subject-verb-object relationships.  
- [LEXICON] The text contains archaic or obscure vocabulary (e.g., "a stuff," "the thing") that may not be immediately clear to modern readers.  
- [CLARITY] The text is dense with theological concepts and arguments, but the lack of clear transitions and overly formal phrasing reduces readability.  
- [LOGIC] Some arguments rely on assumptions or lack clear logical progression, making the reasoning harder to follow.  

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
