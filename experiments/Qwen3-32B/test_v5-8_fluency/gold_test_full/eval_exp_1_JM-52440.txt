1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] The text contains a few minor grammatical issues, such as missing commas or occasional awkward phrasing, but these are rare and do not significantly interfere with comprehension.  
- [SYNTAX] The sentence structures are generally complex and well-formed, though occasionally lengthy, which may make some sentences slightly harder to follow.  
- [LEXICON] The vocabulary is appropriate and precise for the subject matter, with no instances of inappropriate or unclear word choice.  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors were observed in the text.  
- [STYLE] The text uses formal, archaic language (e.g., "IT is a very easy thing," "I am not about to discuss") that may feel outdated or overly stylized to modern readers, but it is consistent with the tone and context of the historical and theological subject.  

2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5  
The text is mostly fluent, well-structured, and grammatically correct. While the archaic and formal style may feel less natural to modern readers, it does not impede understanding. There are only a few minor grammatical or syntactic issues that do not significantly disrupt the flow or clarity of the text.
