Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward or unclear sentence structure in "The home assistant played ambient music."  
- [SYNTAX] Disjointed phrasing in "The energy grid remained balanced."  
- [SYNTAX] Unclear connection between events in "He is an inveterate sportsman" (sentence cuts off mid-idea).  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing punctuation in "He gives you much fine advice which you never forget." (comma after "advice" would improve clarity).  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing punctuation in "The owner and editor is John D. West." (should be "are").  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing punctuation in "The editorâ€™s sanctum is at the front. His desk is at the big window." (sentence could be combined or comma added for flow).  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing punctuation in "He is standing in a market wagon and has a companion who strums a guitar and sings." (could use em dash or semicolon for clarity).  
- [LEXICON] Unnatural phrasing in "You are the artist. Your mamma, with other mammas, is sitting on the platform." ("Your mamma" is an old-fashioned phrasing that may feel out of place).  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "Having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay of a lower-case beside the window..." (awkward word order).  
- [SYNTAX] Unclear sentence structure in "The home assistant played ambient music." (contextually irrelevant or misplaced).
