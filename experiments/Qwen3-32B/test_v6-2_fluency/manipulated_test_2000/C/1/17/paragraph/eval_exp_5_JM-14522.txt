Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect use of capitalization (e.g., "THE CANTERVILLE GHOST" should not be all caps)  
- [GRAMMAR] Sentence fragments and incomplete thoughts (e.g., "I said I should have been glad to show him any attention on our friendâ€™s introduction.")  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "The old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice, 'It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on that very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.")  
- [GRAMMAR] Misuse of tenses and inconsistent verb forms (e.g., "He had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion not unconnected with that range of feeling.")  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward and overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "We have to induce deliberately the 'Christmas feeling.'")  
- [SYNTAX] Repetitive and convoluted phrasing (e.g., "We do not have to brace and force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday.")  
- [LEXICON] Use of overly archaic or inappropriate vocabulary (e.g., "The peculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a vacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude towards another vacation--the summer holiday.")  
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent quotation formatting and missing punctuation (e.g., missing commas and periods in dialogue)  
- [GRAMMAR] Misuse of commas and run-on sentences (e.g., "Sir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very mysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his guilty spirit still haunts the Chase.")  
- [GRAMMAR] Illogical or unclear phrasing (e.g., "I do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day.")
