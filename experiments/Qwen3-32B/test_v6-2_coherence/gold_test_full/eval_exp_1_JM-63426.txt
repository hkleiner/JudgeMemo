Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text is written in a first-person narrative style for most of the biography, but then switches to a third-person narrative in the "Afterword" and "Chronology" sections, creating a jarring shift in perspective.
- [STRUCTURE] The text contains multiple nested narratives and time shifts without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the chronological flow of events.
- [CLARITY] The text frequently shifts between past, present, and hypothetical tenses within the same paragraph without clear indication of these shifts.
- [STRUCTURE] The biography is written in a novelistic style with fictionalized accounts of Will Bradley's life, rather than a straightforward chronological biography.
- [TRANSITION] There are abrupt transitions between different periods of Bradley's life without clear connections or explanations.
- [CLARITY] The text contains many anachronistic references and modern language that would not be appropriate for the time periods being described.
- [STRUCTURE] The text mixes biographical information with commentary, analysis, and fictionalized accounts without clear demarcation between these elements.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
