Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] The transition from the ghost's dramatic appearance to the family's casual reaction is jarring and lacks logical consistency. - [CLARITY] The sudden shift from the ghost's dramatic attempts to frighten the family to being outwitted by a prank is not clearly explained. - [STRUCTURE] The pacing and structure of the ghost's attempts to frighten the family are inconsistent, with some episodes feeling rushed and others overly detailed. - [LOGIC] The resolution of the ghost's haunting through Virginia's compassion is introduced abruptly and lacks sufficient buildup. - [TRANSITION] The transition from the ghost's torment to his death and the subsequent funeral is abrupt and lacks emotional continuity. - [LOGIC] The final dialogue between Virginia and the Duke feels disconnected from the rest of the narrative and lacks thematic coherence.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5
