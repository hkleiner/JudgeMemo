Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text is extremely long and dense, making it difficult to follow the overall structure and progression of ideas.
- [CLARITY] The writing is often convoluted and uses complex theological terminology that can obscure the main points.
- [LOGIC] There are numerous logical leaps and assumptions that are not clearly explained or supported.
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs and sections are often abrupt or missing, making it difficult to follow the flow of the argument.
- [CLARITY] The text frequently shifts between abstract theological concepts and specific references to church documents without clear connections.
- [STRUCTURE] The repetitive nature of the argument (especially in the sections on the Articles and Catechism) can make it feel redundant and disorganized.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
