Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and logical structure; it jumps between different topics and descriptions without a coherent flow.
- [LOGIC] The argument for the Garden of Eden being in the Mississippi River valley is weak and lacks logical consistency or supporting evidence.
- [TRANSITION] There are poor transitions between paragraphs, making it difficult to follow the author's reasoning or narrative.
- [CLARITY] The text is overly verbose and repetitive, with unclear explanations and confusing descriptions that hinder comprehension.
- [COHERENCE] The overall message is inconsistent, with the author presenting a strong claim without sufficient justification or rebuttal of counterarguments.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
