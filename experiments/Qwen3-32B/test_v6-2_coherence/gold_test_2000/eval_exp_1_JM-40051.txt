Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and logical organization, jumping between descriptive passages and argumentation without a consistent flow.  
- [LOGIC] The argument for identifying a specific location as the Garden of Eden is based on tenuous and subjective connections to biblical descriptions.  
- [TRANSITION] There are abrupt shifts between ideas and locations without smooth transitions, making it difficult to follow the author's reasoning.  
- [CLARITY] Some phrases are overly vague or poetic, such as "the finger of time has been plainly pointing," which do not contribute to a clear argument.  
- [COHERENCE] The text repeatedly refers to "our garden" and "our Euphrates" without clearly establishing the referents or justifying the claims.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
