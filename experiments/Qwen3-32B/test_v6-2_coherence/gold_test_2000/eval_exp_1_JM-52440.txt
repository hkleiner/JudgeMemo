Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly between abstract theological concepts and practical implications without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] Some arguments are introduced without sufficient context or connection to the main thesis, such as the sudden discussion of Rome’s doctrine.  
- [CLARITY] The distinction between the Church of England’s doctrine and other theological positions is occasionally unclear or muddled.  
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs and sections are weak, making the flow of ideas difficult to follow.  
- [LOGIC] The argument occasionally assumes prior knowledge without explanation, potentially confusing readers unfamiliar with the subject matter.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
