Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from a serious ghost narrative to a lighthearted and humorous tone with no clear transition.  
- [CLARITY] The introduction of complex historical and supernatural elements is followed by an abrupt switch to American cultural references and humor, which disrupts the reader's immersion.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between detailed descriptions of the Otis family and the ghost's dramatic appearance without sufficient context or buildup.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the family’s arrival and setup to the ghost’s appearance is abrupt and lacks narrative cohesion.  
- [LOGIC] The ghost’s reaction to the American Minister's practical solution is overly theatrical and inconsistent with the otherwise realistic tone of the family's responses.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
