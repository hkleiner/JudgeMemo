Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and logical structure, with abrupt shifts between topics and sections without smooth transitions.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and convoluted, making it difficult to follow the argument or main points.
- [LOGIC] There are logical inconsistencies and leaps in reasoning, particularly in theological arguments, that are not well-supported or explained.
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and sections are weak or nonexistent, leading to a disjointed reading experience.
- [COHERENCE] The overall coherence is compromised by the lack of a unified narrative thread and the presence of repetitive or redundant arguments.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
