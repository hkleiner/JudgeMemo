Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] The transition between the American family's initial dismissal of the ghost and their eventual acceptance is abrupt and lacks a clear progression.
   - [STRUCTURE] The story jumps between different characters and events without smooth transitions, making it difficult to follow the narrative thread.
   - [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and contain unnecessary details that distract from the main plot.
   - [LOGIC] The ghost's motivations and emotional responses are inconsistent at times, making his actions less believable.
   - [STRUCTURE] The text includes multiple subplots (e.g., the twins' pranks, the blood-stain, the ghost's various attempts to scare the family) that are not always well integrated into the main narrative.
   - [LOGIC] The resolution involving Virginia and the ghost is introduced quite suddenly after a series of comedic events, with insufficient buildup to make it feel earned.
   - [CLARITY] Some dialogue feels out of place or overly formal compared to the rest of the text, creating a jarring effect.
   - [TRANSITION] The transition from the comedic tone of the ghost's failed attempts to scare the family to the more serious and emotional conclusion is abrupt and not well foreshadowed.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
