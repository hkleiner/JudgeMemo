Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative is generally coherent but has some disjointed sections that disrupt the flow, particularly in the middle of the text where the writing becomes erratic or incoherent for short stretches.
- [CLARITY] Several sentences are grammatically incorrect or poorly constructed, making them difficult to understand (e.g., "The interested dogmatic Otis of he the; and to long of Mr. Messrs. her had the suspect now Washington to when that Psychical").
- [STRUCTURE] Some paragraphs transition abruptly or without clear connection to the previous content, which makes the reading experience less smooth.
- [LOGIC] A few parts of the text contain illogical or confusing statements that are not resolved, such as the ghost's inconsistent behavior and the sudden appearance/disappearance of Virginia without explanation.
- [CLARITY] Some dialogue and descriptions are overly verbose or repetitive, which can distract from the main narrative and reduce coherence.
