Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The text makes several logical leaps without clear connections or evidence, such as equating the Mississippi River with the Euphrates and claiming the specific location as the Garden of Eden without supporting evidence.
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear structure; it moves from one description to another without a logical flow or organization, making it difficult to follow the author's main argument.
- [CLARITY] The text is often unclear and filled with vague or overly complex statements that are difficult to understand, such as the author's claims about the Garden of Eden's size and location.
- [TRANSITION] The text lacks smooth transitions between ideas and paragraphs, resulting in abrupt shifts that disrupt the reader's understanding.
- [LOGIC] The author presents speculative claims as if they were factual, such as the presence of the Garden of Eden in a specific location and the existence of antediluvian settlements, without providing verifiable evidence.
- [CLARITY] There are numerous grammatical and spelling errors that make parts of the text difficult to read and understand, such as "admirirg" and "dimentions."
- [LOGIC] The text conflates religious interpretations with geographical claims without providing a clear rationale for the connections being made.
- [STRUCTURE] The text frequently shifts between describing the scenery, making theological claims, and discussing geological features without a clear unifying theme or purpose.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
