1) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] The narrative occasionally shifts abruptly between different events and timeframes without clear transitions.
- [STRUCTURE] Some paragraphs are overly long and contain multiple disconnected ideas, making it difficult to follow the main narrative thread.
- [CLARITY] Certain sentences are worded in a confusing or ambiguous manner, such as "It was generally assume that the ghost had gone away" and "He was simply but neatly clad in a long shroud."
- [TRANSITION] The text lacks smooth transitions between chapters and major plot developments, causing some disorientation for the reader.
- [LOGIC] There are instances of inconsistent character behavior, such as Virginia suddenly deciding to help the ghost without any clear motivation or buildup.
- [CLARITY] Some phrases use archaic or non-standard English (e.g., "woulded induce," "have come to spend," "am merely") that can confuse modern readers.
