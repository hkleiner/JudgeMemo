Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] The text has a complex and multi-layered structure that can be difficult to follow, especially with the shifting between narrative, analysis, and theories. - [LOGIC] Some logical connections between ideas are weak or unclear, particularly in the analysis of theories and interpretations of the plot. - [CLARITY] The text occasionally uses overly complex language and sentence structures, which can obscure meaning and reduce clarity. - [TRANSITION] Transitions between sections are sometimes abrupt or missing, making it difficult to follow the flow of ideas. - [COHERENCE] The integration of narrative, character analysis, and theoretical interpretation is inconsistent, leading to a fragmented reading experience.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
