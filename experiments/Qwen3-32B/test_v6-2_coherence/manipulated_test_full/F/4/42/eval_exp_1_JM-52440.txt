Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is overly long and lacks clear paragraphing, making it difficult to follow the flow of ideas.  
- [CLARITY] Repetition of points and concepts reduces clarity and makes the argument feel redundant.  
- [TRANSITION] There are weak or missing transitions between sections and paragraphs, especially between theological arguments and their implications.  
- [LOGIC] Some arguments are presented without sufficient evidence or logical progression, making it challenging to assess their validity.  
- [COHERENCE] The dense and formal language, combined with theological jargon, makes the text less accessible and hinders overall coherence for a general reader.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
