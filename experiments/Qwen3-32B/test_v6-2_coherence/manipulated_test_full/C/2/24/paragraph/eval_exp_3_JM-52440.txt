Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text is overly long and dense, making it difficult to follow the logical flow without significant effort.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are convoluted and repetitive, reducing clarity and coherence.
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between sections and ideas are often abrupt or missing, leading to a disjointed reading experience.
- [LOGIC] There are occasional logical inconsistencies or leaps in reasoning that make the argument harder to follow.
- [COHERENCE] The text attempts to cover multiple complex theological topics in a single work, but the integration of these topics is not always seamless, leading to a lack of overall coherence.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
