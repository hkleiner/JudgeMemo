Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and logical structure, making it difficult to follow the argument. There are abrupt shifts between topics and ideas.
- [CLARITY] The text contains numerous unclear or ambiguous phrases, such as "the thing" and "a stuff," which refer to the Church of England but are not clearly defined.
- [TRANSITION] There are poor transitions between paragraphs and sections, leading to a disjointed reading experience.
- [LOGIC] The argumentation is inconsistent and contains logical fallacies. The author often makes assertions without providing sufficient evidence or logical support.
- [COHERENCE] The text frequently contradicts itself or presents ideas in a confusing manner, such as when discussing the nature of the sacraments and the real presence.
- [CLARITY] The text is overly complex and filled with theological jargon that may be difficult for many readers to understand, without sufficient explanation.
- [STRUCTURE] The document appears to be a series of disconnected sermons or lectures rather than a cohesive argument with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
