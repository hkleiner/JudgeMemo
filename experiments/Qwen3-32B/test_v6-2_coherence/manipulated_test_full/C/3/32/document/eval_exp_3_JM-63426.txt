Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and consistent structure, with abrupt shifts between different sections and a lack of logical flow between paragraphs. - [LOGIC] There are numerous logical inconsistencies and unclear transitions, making it difficult to follow the narrative and understand the relationships between ideas. - [CLARITY] The text contains vague and ambiguous references (e.g., "the stuff," "a thing") that hinder comprehension and make it challenging to track the narrative. - [TRANSITION] The transitions between chapters and sections are abrupt and often disconnected, lacking smooth progression or contextual linkage. - [COHERENCE] The overall narrative is fragmented, with some sections reading like disjointed anecdotes rather than contributing to a unified whole. - [ORGANIZATION] The chronology and sequence of events are not consistently maintained, leading to confusion about the timeline of Will Bradley's life and career.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
