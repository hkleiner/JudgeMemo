Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between multiple plotlines and character interactions without clear transitions.
- [LOGIC] The American family's consistent dismissal of the supernatural is undermined by their eventual fear and concern for Virginia.
- [CLARITY] The text contains numerous references to "the stuff" and "a thing" which are unclear and confusing.
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shifts in tone and perspective occur without explanation, making the narrative flow disjointed.
- [CLARITY] The text contains many anachronisms and modern references that don't align with the 16th-century ghost's backstory.
- [LOGIC] The ghost's behavior is inconsistent - he is both powerful and easily outwitted by the American family.
- [CLARITY] The text contains many non-sequiturs and illogical statements that don't connect to the main narrative.
- [STRUCTURE] The story's climax with Virginia and the ghost is introduced abruptly without sufficient buildup.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
