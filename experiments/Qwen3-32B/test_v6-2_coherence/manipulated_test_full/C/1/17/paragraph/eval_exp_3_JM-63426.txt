Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and consistent structure, with abrupt shifts between different time periods and topics.  
- [LOGIC] There are logical inconsistencies and missing connections between ideas, especially in the transition between personal anecdotes and broader historical commentary.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are unclear or overly complex, making it difficult to follow the author’s intent or the narrative flow.  
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs and sections are often weak or absent, leading to a disjointed reading experience.  
- [FOCUS] The text occasionally strays from its central theme (Will Bradley’s contributions to design) into unrelated tangents or descriptions.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
