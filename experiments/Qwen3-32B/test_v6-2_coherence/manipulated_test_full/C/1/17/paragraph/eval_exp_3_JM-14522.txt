Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] The text has an inconsistent structure with large chunks of unrelated content, such as a detailed discussion about the solstice and calendar systems that are not connected to the ghost story.
   - [LOGIC] There are logical inconsistencies, such as the sudden appearance of unrelated historical anecdotes and scientific discussions about animal adaptation.
   - [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and chapters are abrupt and often disjointed, making it difficult to follow the narrative flow.
   - [CLARITY] Some sections are confusing due to unclear connections between ideas, such as the random insertion of travel descriptions and unrelated philosophical musings.
   - [COHESION] The text lacks cohesive elements that would tie the various disconnected segments together into a unified narrative.
2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
