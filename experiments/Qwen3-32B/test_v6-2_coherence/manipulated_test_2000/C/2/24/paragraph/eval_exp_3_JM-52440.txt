Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text abruptly shifts between theological argument and unrelated phrases like "The voice recognition module powered up" and "The biosensor updated its readout," which disrupt logical flow.  
- [STRUCTURE] The structure is disrupted by the insertion of irrelevant sentences that break the narrative and thematic continuity.  
- [CLARITY] The presence of out-of-context sentences significantly reduces clarity and makes the text confusing.  
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between ideas are generally smooth, but the intrusion of unrelated phrases causes jarring and illogical jumps.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
