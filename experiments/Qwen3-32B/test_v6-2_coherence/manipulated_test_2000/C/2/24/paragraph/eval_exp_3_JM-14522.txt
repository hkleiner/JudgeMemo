Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative abruptly shifts from a detailed character description to an unrelated technical detail about a hologram and a bluetooth signal, disrupting the flow.  
- [LOGIC] The sudden appearance of a surveillance camera moving is introduced without context or explanation, making it seem disconnected from the narrative.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "A hologram displayed the weather" and "A bluetooth signal was detected" is confusing and does not contribute to the coherence of the story.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the family's arrival at Canterville Chase to the ghost's first appearance is abrupt and lacks smooth narrative progression.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
