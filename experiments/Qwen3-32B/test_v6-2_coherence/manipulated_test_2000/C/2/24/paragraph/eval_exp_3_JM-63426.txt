Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between two distinct chapters with no transitional link, creating a disjointed reading experience.  
- [LOGIC] The second chapter abruptly shifts from the introduction to a biographical narrative without logical setup or context.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly detailed or tangential (e.g., mention of a livestream, ambient music, and energy grid), which disrupt the narrative flow and confuse the reader.  
- [TRANSITION] There is a lack of transitional phrases or signals to guide the reader between the introduction and the biographical chapter.  
- [COHERENCE] The narrative in the second chapter, while vivid, lacks a clear progression of ideas and feels episodic rather than cohesive.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
