1) Coherence Issues:

- [LOGIC] Unclear or missing connections between Bradley’s early life and his later artistic impact, making the relevance of the childhood narrative less obvious.  
- [CLARITY] Frequent use of vague or ambiguous terms like “a thing,” “a stuff,” and “the thing” that disrupt clarity and immersion.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative shifts between biographical details and commentary without consistent organization or thematic grouping.
