Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts in narrative tone between the ghost story and the American family's dismissive attitude.  
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent character reactions; the ghost's dramatic appearance is met with overly casual and humorous responses.  
- [CLARITY] Unclear references to "a thing," "a stuff," and "the stuff" throughout the text, causing confusion.  
- [TRANSITION] Poor transitions between chapters, especially between the family's arrival and the sudden reappearance of the blood stain.  
- [COHERENCE] Lack of resolution or explanation for the ghost's reappearance and the family's changing attitudes.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
