Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and consistent structure, with abrupt shifts between topics and unclear organization of ideas.  
- [LOGIC] Some arguments are presented without sufficient logical connection to the main thesis or to each other.  
- [CLARITY] Several key terms and phrases (e.g., "the thing," "the stuff") are used ambiguously or unclearly, causing confusion.  
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and sections are weak or nonexistent, leading to a disjointed reading experience.  
- [COHERENCE] The repetition of ideas and lack of resolution of key questions undermine the overall coherence of the text.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
