Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from the Canterville Ghost narrative to a discussion of Dickens and Edwin Drood without clear connection.  
- [LOGIC] Disjointed transition from Lord Cantervilleâ€™s conversation to an unrelated narrative about Stransom and Mary Antrim.  
- [CLARITY] Unclear reference to "Mrs. Creston" and the ambiguity of her status is introduced without sufficient context.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt jump from the ghost narrative to a philosophical discussion of Christmas and its perceived artificiality.  
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear chapter boundaries or thematic unity between the ghost story and other inserted narratives.  
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent tone between the ghost story and the more academic or reflective sections.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
