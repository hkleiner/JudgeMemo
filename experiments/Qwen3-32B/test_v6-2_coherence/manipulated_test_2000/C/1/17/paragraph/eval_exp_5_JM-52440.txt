Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from a theological discussion to a ghost story and then to a character’s personal reflection without logical connection.  
- [LOGIC] The text abruptly transitions between unrelated topics (e.g., Church of England doctrine, a family encountering a ghost, and a man’s emotional reaction to a woman’s death), creating confusion about the central focus.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitions between sections, especially between the introduction and the first chapter, and between the theological content and the narrative segments.  
- [CLARITY] The narrative segments (e.g., the blood stain, Washington’s letter) are incomplete and cut off mid-sentence, making them confusing and disconnected.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text appears to be a patchwork of different genres (theological treatise, gothic fiction, personal reflection) with no coherent unifying structure.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
