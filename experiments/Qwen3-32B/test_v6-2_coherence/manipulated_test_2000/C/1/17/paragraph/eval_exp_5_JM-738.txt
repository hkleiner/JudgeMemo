Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text abruptly shifts from a general discussion of Dickens’s writing style to a specific narrative involving characters like Stransom, Mary Antrim, and Paul Creston, with no clear connection to the thesis on *Edwin Drood*.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph describing the Eve and the "supreme day" is emotionally vivid but lacks clear relevance to the analysis of Dickens’s plot construction, making it a disjointed insertion.  
- [CLARITY] The narrative section involving Stransom and Paul Creston is introduced without sufficient context or explanation, leaving the reader confused about its purpose.  
- [TRANSITION] There is a jarring transition from the discussion of Dickens’s theories to the unrelated quote about Lord Canterville and a ghost, which appears to belong to a different text or context.  
- [COHERENCE] The text oscillates between scholarly analysis, narrative vignettes, and biographical asides, creating an overall lack of unified focus.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
