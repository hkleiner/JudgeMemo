Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from the introduction about Will Bradley to a detailed narrative about unrelated characters (Stransom, Mary Antrim, Paul Creston) without clear connection to Bradley.  
- [LOGIC] The text abruptly transitions from discussing Bradley’s career and impact to a seemingly unrelated anecdote about a jeweler’s shop and a romantic ambiguity, which lacks logical connection to the main subject.  
- [CLARITY] The narrative about Stransom and the jeweler is confusing and does not clarify its relevance to Will Bradley or the book’s purpose.  
- [TRANSITION] Poor transitions between sections and ideas, especially between the introduction and the detailed childhood narrative of Bradley, making the flow disjointed.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear organizational framework; it jumps between biographical details, abstract reflections, and unrelated narrative passages without guiding the reader smoothly.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
