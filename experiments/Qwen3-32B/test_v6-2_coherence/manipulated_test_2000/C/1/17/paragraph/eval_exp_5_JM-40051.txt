Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between unrelated topics and sections, such as the author's discovery of Eden, a romantic subplot involving Jasper and Rosa, and a scene from a house in Canterville Chase, with no logical transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The argument for identifying the Garden of Eden with a specific location in America is inconsistent and lacks a clear, logical progression.  
- [CLARITY] The text is confusing in places due to vague references and unclear connections between ideas.  
- [TRANSITION] There are no smooth transitions between the different narrative threads or sections, making the text feel disjointed.  
- [COHERENCE] The text fails to maintain a unified theme or purpose, blending historical, religious, and fictional elements without integration.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
