Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and logical organizational structure, making it difficult to follow the author's argument.  
- [LOGIC] The argument for locating the Garden of Eden in the Mississippi River valley is based on weak and speculative reasoning with little coherent evidence.  
- [CLARITY] The writing is riddled with grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and unclear sentences that hinder comprehension.  
- [TRANSITION] There are no smooth transitions between ideas, leading to abrupt shifts in focus and confusion.  
- [COHERENCE] The text jumps between descriptions of the landscape, theological speculation, and anecdotal claims without a unifying thread.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
