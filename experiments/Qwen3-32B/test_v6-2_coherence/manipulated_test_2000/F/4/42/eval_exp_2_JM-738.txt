Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear organization in the analysis of *The Mystery of Edwin Drood*, making it difficult to follow the argument.  
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent flow between the introduction and the analysis of characters, with abrupt transitions.  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous or unclear references (e.g., "Mr. Cuming Walters suggests...") without sufficient context.  
- [TRANSITION] Poor transitions between paragraphs, especially between the introduction and the "Story" chapter.  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetition of ideas without progression, such as the repeated emphasis on opium and Jasperâ€™s obsession.  
- [LOGIC] Some assertions are made without supporting evidence or logical explanation (e.g., the claim that Jasper may have supernatural premonitions).  
- [CLARITY] Overuse of archaic or awkward phrasing (e.g., "He was being watched by the hag") that hinders readability.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
