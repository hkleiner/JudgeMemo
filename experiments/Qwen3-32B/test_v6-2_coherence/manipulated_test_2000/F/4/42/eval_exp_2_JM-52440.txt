Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between abstract theological discussion and specific doctrinal analysis without clear transitions, making the logical flow difficult to follow.  
- [LOGIC] The argument occasionally introduces new points without sufficient connection to the previous discussion, leading to confusion about the central thesis.  
- [CLARITY] The use of archaic and inconsistent verb forms (e.g., "was not say," "was not referred") disrupts readability and clarity.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the introduction to the first chapter is abrupt, and the relationship between the introduction and the subsequent doctrinal analysis is not clearly established.  
- [CLARITY] Some key terms, such as "Real Presence," are used without clear definition early in the text, making it difficult for the reader to follow the debate.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
