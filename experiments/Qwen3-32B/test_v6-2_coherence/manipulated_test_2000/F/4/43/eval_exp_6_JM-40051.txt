Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and logical structure, jumping between descriptions, arguments, and narrative elements without a coherent flow.  
- [LOGIC] The argument for identifying a specific geographical location as the Garden of Eden is based on tenuous and speculative connections, with weak logical support.  
- [CLARITY] Many sentences are poorly constructed, with grammatical errors, run-on phrases, and unclear syntax that hinder comprehension.  
- [TRANSITION] There are no effective transitions between paragraphs or ideas, making the text feel disjointed and difficult to follow.  
- [COHERENCE] The text contains contradictory or inconsistent claims, such as shifting between the Garden of Eden being a mythical place and a specific, identifiable location.  
- [COHERENCE] The author introduces new ideas and evidence without linking them to the central argument, leading to a fragmented narrative.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
