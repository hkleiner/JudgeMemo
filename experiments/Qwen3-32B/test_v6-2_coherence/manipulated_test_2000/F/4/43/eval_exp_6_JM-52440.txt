1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and consistent organizational flow, especially in the latter sections where ideas become convoluted and repetitive.  
- [CLARITY] Several sentences are grammatically incorrect or poorly constructed, making the meaning unclear or difficult to follow.  
- [LOGIC] There are logical inconsistencies in the argumentation, particularly in the discussion of sacraments and the distinction between sign and substance.  
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs and ideas are abrupt or missing, leading to a disjointed reading experience.  
- [COHERENCE] The overall text suffers from a lack of unity, with some sections drifting away from the central thesis without clear connection or resolution.
