Evaluation Form:
1) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] The text abruptly shifts from the family's introduction to the ghost's appearance without clear narrative flow. - [CLARITY] Several typographical errors and misspellings (e.g., "seej," "afger," "xven") disrupt comprehension. - [LOGIC] The return of the bloodstain is introduced without sufficient context or explanation, creating confusion. - [TRANSITION] The transition from the family's evening drive to the ghost's appearance is jarring and lacks smooth progression. - [COHERENCE] The ghost's reaction to the lubricator is sudden and illogical, lacking buildup or character motivation. - [STRUCTURE] The chapter ends with an unresolved action (the pillow thrown at the ghost), leaving the reader hanging without closure.

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
