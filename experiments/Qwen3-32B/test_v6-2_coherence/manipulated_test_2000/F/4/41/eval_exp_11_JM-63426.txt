Evaluation Form:  
1) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear organization between the introduction and the narrative section; abrupt shift in tone and focus.  
- [LOGIC] Disconnected ideas in the first chapter, such as sudden shifts from Bradley’s legacy to historical context without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] Unclear or ambiguous references (e.g., “Kelmscott House,” “Universalists and Unitarians”) without sufficient explanation for general readers.  
- [TRANSITION] Poor transitions between paragraphs and chapters, making the flow between ideas disjointed.  
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent timeline presentation in the second chapter, with events described in a non-sequential or fragmented manner.  
- [CLARITY] Numerous typographical and grammatical errors (e.g., “wre,” “cemts,” “prrss”) that disrupt readability and comprehension.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative in the second chapter reads more like a fictionalized account than a biographical or analytical text, which conflicts with the tone of the first chapter.  

2) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
