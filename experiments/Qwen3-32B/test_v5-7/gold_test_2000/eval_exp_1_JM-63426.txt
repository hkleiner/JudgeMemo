1) Fluency Issues:  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or inconsistent punctuation in some sentences (e.g., "It is graduation day in the little brown schoolhouse on Baltimore Street in Lynn, Massachusetts, just outside Boston. Miss Parrot is the teacher--a dear!")  
- [GRAMMAR] Some grammatical inconsistencies, such as missing articles or unclear subject-verb agreement (e.g., "You are the artist. Your mamma, with other mammas, is sitting on the platform...")  
- [LEXICON] Some awkward phrasing or word choices that are not idiomatic in modern English (e.g., "You are on the 'Narrow Gauge' on your way to Boston")  
- [SPELLING] Minor spelling issues (e.g., "pi" instead of "ink" in "When you succeed in finding a few letters of the same font you file them to fit the type slot in the press.")  
- [SYNTAX] Some run-on sentences or sentences with unclear structure that make reading more difficult (e.g., "The editorâ€™s sanctum is at the front. His desk is at the big window.")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Some abrupt transitions between paragraphs and ideas, making it difficult to follow the narrative flow (e.g., sudden shift from childhood memories to historical context)  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative alternates between past events and reflections in a way that is not always clearly connected or explained  
- [CLARITY] Some references are unclear or lack sufficient context for full understanding (e.g., "the 'Narrow Gauge'")  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitions between the introduction and the "Boy Printer of Ishpeming" chapter, making the shift in tone and content jarring  
- [PERSPECTIVE] The shift between first-person narrative and historical commentary is not always smoothly handled, causing confusion in perspective
