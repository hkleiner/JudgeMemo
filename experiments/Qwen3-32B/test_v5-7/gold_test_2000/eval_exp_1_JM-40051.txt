2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear structure; it jumps between descriptive passages, historical references, and personal anecdotes without clear transitions  
- [LOGIC] The argument for locating the Garden of Eden in a specific location is based on weak and speculative reasoning, with little logical progression  
- [CLARITY] The author frequently uses vague or ambiguous language that makes it difficult to follow the intended meaning  
- [LOGIC] The connection between the Bible and the geography of the Mississippi River is tenuous and not well-supported  
- [LOGIC] The text assumes the reader is familiar with specific local geography and historical context without providing sufficient background  
- [TRANSITION] The text lacks smooth transitions between ideas, making it difficult to follow the author’s reasoning  
- [LOGIC] The author makes sweeping claims without providing evidence or logical support  
- [LOGIC] The argument is based on a series of assumptions and speculative interpretations rather than a coherent, evidence-based analysis
