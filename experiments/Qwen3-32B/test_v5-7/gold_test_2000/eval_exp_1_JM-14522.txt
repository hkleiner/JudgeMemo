1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] "phantasmata" is an overly complex and archaic term that may confuse readers.  
- [GRAMMAR] "I have always been of opinion that emigration is the only thing for England" – missing "the" before "opinion."  
- [GRAMMAR] "The blood-stain has been much admired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed" – the phrase is grammatically correct but slightly awkward in tone.  
- [SPELLING] "Paragon Detergent" is repeated in the same sentence, which is repetitive but not a spelling issue.  
- [SYNTAX] "I have always been of opinion that emigration is the only thing for England" – awkward phrasing; more natural phrasing would be "I have always believed that emigration is the only solution for England."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the description of the family to the appearance of the ghost is abrupt.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is well-structured overall, but the ghost's introduction feels sudden after a long narrative setup.  
- [CLARITY] The line "I have seen things with my own eyes, sir, that would make any Christian's hair stand on end" is somewhat vague and could be more specific.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the family's conversation to the ghost's appearance is jarring and lacks smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The use of American products to remove the blood stain is humorous and consistent with the tone, but the repetition of the stain is not clearly explained.

4) FINAL Fluency Score: [4.0]
