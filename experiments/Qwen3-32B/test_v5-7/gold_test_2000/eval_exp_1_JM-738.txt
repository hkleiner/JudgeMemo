1) Fluency Issues:  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or incorrect punctuation in some sentences, such as missing commas after introductory phrases.  
- [SPELLING] Some words are inconsistently capitalized or improperly formatted (e.g., “_Bleak House_” and “_Pickwick_” with inconsistent use of italics and capitalization).  
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly complex and difficult to follow, such as: “He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character.”  
- [STYLE] Some phrasing is archaic or outdated, which may be stylistically appropriate but can be confusing to modern readers.  
- [REPETITION] Some repetition of ideas and phrases, such as the repeated emphasis on “secrets” and “atmosphere” without clear distinction.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The structure of the text is somewhat disjointed, with abrupt transitions between sections and ideas.  
- [LOGIC] Some arguments or comparisons are not clearly explained or supported, such as the comparison between Dickens and Wilkie Collins without a clear rationale.  
- [CLARITY] Certain concepts, such as the role of John Jasper and the significance of the cathedral, are introduced but not consistently elaborated.  
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs and sections are sometimes abrupt or unclear, making the flow of the text difficult to follow.  
- [CONTEXT] Some references to literary works or characters are not fully explained, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the context.
