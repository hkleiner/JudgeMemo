1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "I am not now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in the 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper." – awkward phrasing and repetition of "refer"  
- [GRAMMAR] "I am not now making any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is the great point to be determined." – slightly unclear phrasing  
- [SPELLING] "consecration produces no change in its quality or substance." – "its" is correctly used, but the sentence could be clearer  
- [LEXICON] "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject..." – inconsistent punctuation and formatting  
- [GRAMMAR] "The water is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the consecration produces no change in its quality or substance." – sentence is grammatically correct but could be more concise  
- [GRAMMAR] "It is not my business now to discuss the connexion between the visible sign and the invisible gift." – "connexion" is a British variant, but may be less familiar to some readers  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between theological definitions and historical context without clear transitions, which may confuse the reader  
- [LOGIC] The argument is dense and assumes prior knowledge of Christian theology, making it difficult for a general reader to follow the reasoning  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and use archaic or theological language, reducing clarity  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the introduction to the analysis of the Articles is abrupt and lacks a clear transition  
- [LOGIC] The argument relies heavily on theological assumptions without clearly stating them upfront, which may make the logic less accessible  
- [CLARITY] The distinction between the "real presence" and the Reformation view is not always clearly explained, especially for readers unfamiliar with the context  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
