1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He closes here with chuckling praises of the fine, free-handed job they are doing." – Awkward phrasing.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The blackboard is covered with chalk drawings: sailboats, steamboats, ferryboats, trains of cars, houses, people and animals." – Missing comma before "and" in a list.  
- [GRAMMAR] "Your father is ill, an aftermath of the Civil War." – Awkward phrasing; should be "an aftereffect of the Civil War" or "a result of the Civil War."  
- [GRAMMAR] "Your mother and you are now alone in the world and you are on the 'Narrow Gauge' on your way to Boston." – Repetition of "you are."  
- [GRAMMAR] "You don’t like arithmetic, anyway." – Informal phrasing that feels out of place in a narrative style.  
- [GRAMMAR] "He noticed you, but said that as he had not the pleasure of your personal acquaintance he would not trouble you." – Awkward phrasing and missing comma.  
- [GRAMMAR] "Having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay of a lower-case beside the window..." – Awkward syntax and unclear phrasing.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The print shop is above a saloon and in one corner of a big barn of a room that had been a lodge hall." – Awkward and confusing structure.  
- [GRAMMAR] "You and your devil forage in the snowdrifts of the alley back of the building and 'borrow' packing boxes to get kindling for the stove and boiler." – Ambiguous use of "devil" (likely a typo for "devil" as a printer's assistant, but still unclear).  
- [GRAMMAR] "The editor’s sanctum is at the front. His desk is at the big window." – Slightly awkward phrasing.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text abruptly shifts from a biographical introduction of Will Bradley to a narrative about Stransom and Paul Creston, which is unrelated and confusing.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative about Stransom and the jeweller's shop is disconnected from the main theme of Will Bradley's life and career.  
- [CLARITY] The text is written in a mix of first-person and third-person narrative, which is jarring and confusing.  
- [LOGIC] The introduction of "Sir Simon" and the Chase with the blood-stain is unrelated and appears to be a fragment from another text.  
- [LOGIC] The text jumps from the introduction of Will Bradley to a detailed narrative about a boy printer in Ishpeming without clear transition or connection.  
- [LOGIC] The section about the Iron Ore newspaper and the printer's work is detailed and well-structured, but the earlier and later sections lack similar clarity.  
- [LOGIC] The introduction mentions the analysis of "Dickens’s last plot," but this is never elaborated on.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the faker selling soap and the editor’s actions is left incomplete, with no resolution or connection to the rest of the text.
