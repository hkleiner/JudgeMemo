1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note occurred." (awkward phrasing; could be more concise)  
- [SPELLING] "Paragon Detergent" (not an error, but the term is oddly capitalized and may be unclear)  
- [SYNTAX] "He accordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning it appeared again." (awkward transition and phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "The third morning also it was there, though the library had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key carried up-stairs." (passive voice and phrasing is confusing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He had known her twenty years, and she was the only woman for whom he might perhaps have been unfaithful." (awkward phrasing and sentence structure)  
- [SYNTAX] "Without accidents he had loved her, without accidents every one had loved her: she had made the passions about her as regular as the moon makes the tides." (repetition and unclear metaphor)  
- [SPELLING] "up-stairs" (should be hyphenated as "upstairs")  
- [GRAMMAR] "The people at home would never have mentioned extradition." (vague and unclear reference)  
- [GRAMMAR] "This was a wife for foreign service or purely external use" (awkward phrasing and unclear meaning)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text shifts abruptly between religious theological discussion and a ghost story and a narrative about a character named George Stransom, with no clear connection between them.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text appears to be a collection of disjointed excerpts from different works, including a ghost story, theological treatise, and a narrative, with no cohesive structure or theme.  
- [CLARITY] The transition between the theological discussion and the ghost story is abrupt and confusing, making it difficult to understand the overall purpose or message of the text.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the theological text to the ghost story and then to the narrative about George Stransom is jarring and lacks any logical or thematic connection.  
- [LOGIC] The theological argument is presented in a formal and structured manner, but the narrative sections are written in a more literary and descriptive style, creating a mismatch in tone and purpose.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear introduction or conclusion that would help unify the different sections and provide context for the reader.  
- [CLARITY] The use of different characters, settings, and themes in the text makes it difficult to determine the intended audience or purpose.
