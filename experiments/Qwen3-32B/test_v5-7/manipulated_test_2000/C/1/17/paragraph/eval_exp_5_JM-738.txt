1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Some critics may think, that since so many of the best novels in the world 'have no outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a demned outline,' elaborate construction is not absolutely 'essential.'" – The comma after "think" is unnecessary and disrupts the flow.  
- [SPELLING] "demned outline" – likely a typo for "demon outline" or "dumb outline," but the exact intended meaning is unclear.  
- [SYNTAX] "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises." – The sentence is grammatically correct but awkward in phrasing. A smoother version might be "He constructed elaborate plots, filled with secrets and surprises."  
- [LEXICON] "Youth will be served;" – The phrase is vague and unclear in this context. It appears to be a metaphor but is not well-explained.  
- [GRAMMAR] "He had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion not unconnected with that range of feeling." – The sentence is grammatically correct but awkward and overly complex.  
- [SPELLING] "Stransom lingered long enough to suspend, in a vision, a string of pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim..." – The sentence is grammatically correct but uses an unusual phrasing that is slightly confusing.  
- [GRAMMAR] "He coloured as well as smiled in the strong light of the shop when Stransom raised a tentative hat to the lady." – The sentence is grammatically correct but awkwardly structured.  
- [GRAMMAR] "Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But there is no such thing, sir, as a ghost..." – This sentence appears to be an intrusion from another text (possibly from Oscar Wilde's *The Canterville Ghost*), making it irrelevant and confusing in the context of the Dickens analysis.  
- [GRAMMAR] "He must remember that, according to Forster, 'such was Dickens’s interest in things supernatural that, but for the strong restraining power of his common sense, he might have fallen into the follies of spiritualism.'" – The sentence is grammatically correct but overly complex and could be simplified for clarity.  
- [GRAMMAR] "If I am right, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material premonitions of 'The Signalman' in Mugby Junction." – The sentence is grammatically correct but awkward in phrasing.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text is a scholarly analysis of Dickens’s work, but the sudden appearance of a sentence from *The Canterville Ghost* ("Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville...") is illogical and disrupts the flow of the argument.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is generally well-structured as an academic essay, but the introduction of the unrelated quote from *The Canterville Ghost* creates a jarring shift in tone and subject.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "Youth will be served;" is unclear in meaning and does not contribute to the argument in a meaningful way.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition between the analysis of Dickens’s writing style and the unrelated quote from *The Canterville Ghost* is abrupt and lacks logical connection.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "He had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion not unconnected with that range of feeling." – This sentence is grammatically correct but lacks clarity and could be confusing to the reader.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "Sapsea and Durdles" appears to be a fragment from a different text (possibly from Dickens’s *Bleak House* or another novel) and is not logically connected to the main argument about *Edwin Drood*.
