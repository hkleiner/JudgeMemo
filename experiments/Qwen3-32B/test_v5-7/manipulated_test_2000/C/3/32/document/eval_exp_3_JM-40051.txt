- [GRAMMAR] "having become thoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it" – ungrammatical phrasing; likely intended to be "a reasonable understanding of it".  
- [SPELLING] "antldiluvians" – misspelled; should be "antediluvians".  
- [GRAMMAR] "and gave a description of the location—and it not being on that continent" – missing article before "it not being".

- [GRAMMAR] "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the “North West,” as the place" – awkward phrasing and unclear logic.

- [SPELLING] "stuff" – repeated inappropriately throughout the text (e.g., "from Eden to water the garden,——And from thence,——it was which means long river...").  
- [GRAMMAR] "the river and bottoms are about two miles wide, over and through which the “Laughing” and “Father of waters,” courses, run, and play their dances." – subject-verb agreement error.  
- [GRAMMAR] "the second bank is high and dry above the hightest water mark" – "hightest" is misspelled; should be "highest".

- [GRAMMAR] "Please notice the beauty and euphony of those names." – awkward phrasing; "euphony" is used inappropriately.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text lacks a clear thesis or logical progression; it jumps between descriptions of the landscape, biblical references, and personal anecdotes without a unifying thread.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is disorganized and lacks clear paragraphing or sectioning, making it difficult to follow the author's argument.  
- [CLARITY] The author frequently uses vague or undefined terms such as "the thing," "a stuff," and "the garden," which confuse the reader.  
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between ideas are abrupt and often lack explanation or context.  
- [LOGIC] The author makes unsupported claims about the Garden of Eden being in the Mississippi River Valley without providing evidence or logical reasoning.  
- [CLARITY] The text is filled with speculative and poetic language that is not grounded in clear or factual statements.  
- [LOGIC] The argument is circular; the author assumes the location is the Garden of Eden based on its similarity to the biblical description, without providing independent evidence.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is repetitive, with the same ideas and descriptions being restated in different forms without adding new information.  
- [LOGIC] The author conflates personal impressions and speculative ideas with factual claims, blurring the line between opinion and evidence.
