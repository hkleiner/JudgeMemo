1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Repeated use of the word "stuff" in place of "Church" or "teaching," leading to confusion.  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect use of "a thing" and "the thing" as if they refer to theological concepts, likely a placeholder or error.  
- [GRAMMAR] Awkward phrasing: "the documents of the stuff are not studied" – unclear and grammatically incorrect.  
- [GRAMMAR] "But those who are loyal to a stuff ought not to be satisfied..." – unclear and grammatically incorrect.  
- [GRAMMAR] "I believe, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at issue under the three heads of a thing, and the thing..." – incomplete and confusing.  
- [SPELLING] "sacramental" is spelled correctly, but the text contains no major spelling errors.  
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and complex, making them difficult to parse (e.g., the sentence starting with "Now it would be strange indeed...").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The repeated use of "stuff" instead of "Church of England" or "teaching" undermines the clarity of the argument.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "a thing" and "the thing" is vague and does not convey a clear meaning.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is organized into sections and articles, but the frequent use of vague or incorrect terms (e.g., "stuff") disrupts the logical flow.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition between the introduction and the first chapter is abrupt and lacks smooth progression.  
- [LOGIC] The argument is generally logical and well-structured, but the repeated errors with "stuff" and "a thing" create confusion and break the reader's trust in the author's precision.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.0
