1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "a thing" appears repeatedly and seems to be a placeholder or typo.  
- [SPELLING] "a stuff" is used multiple times and appears to be a placeholder or typo.  
- [GRAMMAR] "back a stuff" is grammatically incorrect and confusing.  
- [GRAMMAR] "the Gordon press. Then you receive your first lesson in feeding." The sentence is abrupt and lacks clarity.  
- [SPELLING] "the Gordon press. The two jobbers are kicked." The phrase is unclear and likely a typo or misused term.  
- [SPELLING] "heated (?)" The question mark is unnecessary and disrupts the sentence.  
- [GRAMMAR] "He offers you eight dollars a week. You are not that important to Mr. Newett--and the extra two dollars will enable you to begin saving..." The transition is abrupt and lacks coherence.  
- [SPELLING] "a Gordon" appears without context and is unclear.  
- [GRAMMAR] "Mr. Newett walks leisurely to where there are several guns and fishing rods in a corner." The sentence is incomplete and ends abruptly.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The repeated use of "a thing" and "a stuff" throughout the text is distracting and suggests placeholders that were not corrected, leading to confusion.  
- [CLARITY] The narrative jumps between different time periods and locations without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the timeline.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is written in a first-person narrative style that shifts abruptly between different characters and events, disrupting the flow.  
- [TRANSITION] There are no clear transitions between the chapters or between different events in the life of the protagonist, making the overall structure disjointed.  
- [CONTEXT] Some historical references and terms are used without explanation, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the context (e.g., "Kelmscott House," "Yellow Book," "Universalists and Unitarians").  
- [LOGIC] The narrative includes incomplete sentences and abrupt endings, such as the final sentence about Mr. Newett and the guns, which leaves the reader hanging.
