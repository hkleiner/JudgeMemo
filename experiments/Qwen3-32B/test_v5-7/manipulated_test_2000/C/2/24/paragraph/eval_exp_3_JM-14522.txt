1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] "A hologram displayed the weather." – This sentence is out of context and seems to insert a modern, unrelated technological element without explanation.  
- [LEXICON] "A bluetooth signal was detected." – Another modern, unrelated phrase that disrupts the historical tone of the narrative.  
- [LEXICON] "A surveillance camera moved slightly." – This is another anachronistic phrase that does not fit the 19th-century setting of the story.  
- [STRUCTURE] "Messrs. Myers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains when connected with Crime." – The sentence is incomplete and lacks a closing punctuation mark.  
- [SPELLING] "sanguineous" is spelled correctly but is an unusual and overly formal word choice that may confuse some readers.  
- [SYNTAX] "I have always been of opinion that emigration is the only thing for England." – The phrasing is awkward and could be improved for clarity and natural flow.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The insertion of "A hologram displayed the weather," "A bluetooth signal was detected," and "A surveillance camera moved slightly" disrupts the logical flow and tone of the narrative. These elements are anachronistic and do not align with the 19th-century setting.  
- [STRUCTURE] The story is generally well-structured, but the sudden and unexplained technological references create confusion and distract from the narrative.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the family's arrival at Canterville Chase to the appearance of the ghost is smooth, but the anachronistic elements break the continuity of the story's setting and tone.  
- [CLARITY] The sentence "Messrs. Myers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains when connected with Crime." is incomplete and confusing, leaving the reader without a clear understanding of the intended meaning.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
