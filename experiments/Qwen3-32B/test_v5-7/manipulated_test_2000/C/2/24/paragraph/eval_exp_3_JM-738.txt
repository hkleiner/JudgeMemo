1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Youth will be served;" is followed by a comma splice with the next sentence.  
- [GRAMMAR] "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises. He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character." – Awkward phrasing and missing conjunction.  
- [GRAMMAR] "He therefor abandoned a new series of Readings." – Missing "e" in "therefore."  
- [SPELLING] "He therefor abandoned..." – Incorrect spelling of "therefore."  
- [SYNTAX] "He may be caricatured too much, but not out of reason;" – Unclear phrasing.  
- [SPELLING] "He therefor abandoned..." – Misspelled word.  
- [SPELLING] "We may be sure that he was to see “_that_” in real life." – Unnecessary italics and unclear reference.  
- [GRAMMAR] "He saw in his vision, “_that_, I never saw _that_ before.”" – Awkward phrasing and missing punctuation.  
- [SPELLING] "He therefor abandoned..." – Misspelled word.  
- [SPELLING] "A livestream began recording." – Sudden and irrelevant sentence, possibly a formatting error.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text abruptly ends with "A livestream began recording." – This sentence is unrelated to the academic analysis and disrupts the logical flow.  
- [LOGIC] The text appears to be a scholarly analysis of Dickens's _The Mystery of Edwin Drood_, but the last sentence "A cloud upload completed." and "The digital assistant logged the entry." are out of context and disrupt the coherence.  
- [CLARITY] The text is dense and complex, with some sentences being difficult to follow due to their length and structure.  
- [TRANSITION] Some transitions between paragraphs are abrupt or missing, making the logical progression of ideas less smooth.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "A cloud upload completed" and "The digital assistant logged the entry" at the end of the text is confusing and suggests an inconsistency in the narrative voice.
