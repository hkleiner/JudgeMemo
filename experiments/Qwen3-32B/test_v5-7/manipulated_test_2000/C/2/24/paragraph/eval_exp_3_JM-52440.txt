1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The voice recognition module powered up." and "The biosensor updated its readout." are out-of-place and grammatically correct but disrupt the flow and context of the text.  
- [STYLE] The text contains archaic and overly formal phrasing (e.g., "It is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion," "I am not now discussing in what way we feed on Him") that may be stylistically inconsistent with modern expectations.  
- [LEXICON] Some phrases are overly complex or verbose, which may hinder clarity (e.g., "the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by faith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour").  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected.  
- [PUNCTUATION] The text uses proper punctuation, though some long sentences may be difficult to follow.

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is generally well-structured and logically organized, but the inclusion of the out-of-context sentences ("The voice recognition module powered up" and "The biosensor updated its readout") severely disrupts the flow and coherence.  
- [LOGIC] The argument is logically sound and well-reasoned within the context of theological discussion, but the abrupt transitions and irrelevant sentences undermine the overall coherence.  
- [CLARITY] The theological concepts are clearly explained, but the archaic language and complex sentence structures may reduce clarity for some readers.  
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs and ideas are generally smooth, though the text could benefit from more explicit signposting for clarity.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
