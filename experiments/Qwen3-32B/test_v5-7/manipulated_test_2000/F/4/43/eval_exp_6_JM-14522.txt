1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "I it at short ghost money that, as public time thing there we and or; have in I if all in can" – this sentence is incoherent and grammatically incorrect.  
- [GRAMMAR] "prima reckon Old carrying very, were 'd road as our World one red-a, the your country that with painting the have a a Europe our museums best, oncome modern everything a off in a and and from have fellows young where spry home, of actors such we buy donnas show." – this sentence is grammatically incoherent and lacks proper structure.  
- [SPELLING] "donnas" – likely a misspelling of "donna" or "donna's".  
- [GRAMMAR] "The been-has and admired others blood be by tourists and, much canstain not removed." – this sentence is grammatically incorrect and incoherent.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the whole family went out to drive." – the semicolon usage is awkward and disrupts the flow.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The subjects discussed, as I have since learned from Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of cultured Americans of the better class, such as..." – the repetition of "such as" is awkward and confusing.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The conversation in no way turned upon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of receptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of psychical phenomena." – the sentence is overly complex and difficult to follow.  
- [SPELLING] "phantasmata" – while technically correct, it is unnecessarily archaic and may confuse some readers.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph beginning with "I fear that the ghost exists," is followed by a long, incoherent speech from Mr. Otis that seems to have no clear meaning or purpose. This disrupts the logical flow of the narrative.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph "The been-has and admired others blood be by tourists and, much canstain not removed." is completely incoherent and has no logical connection to the surrounding text.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the description of the Otis family to the events of the stormy night in Chapter II is abrupt and lacks a smooth narrative progression.  
- [CLARITY] The paragraph beginning with "The day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the whole family went out to drive." is overly complex and lacks clarity in its description of events.  
- [LOGIC] The description of the conversation at supper is overly detailed and seems to be included for no clear narrative purpose, disrupting the flow of the story.  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the family's supper conversation to Mr. Otis being awakened by the ghost is abrupt and lacks a smooth narrative connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The overall structure of the text is somewhat disjointed, with some paragraphs lacking a clear connection to the main narrative.
