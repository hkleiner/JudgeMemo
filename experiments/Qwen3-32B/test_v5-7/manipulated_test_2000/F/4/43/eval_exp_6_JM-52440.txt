- [LEXICON] "connexion" is an archaic or uncommon variant of "connection" that may confuse modern readers.  
- [SPELLING] "consecration" is misspelled as "consecration" in the introduction, but this is a repeated correct form.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text shifts abruptly from discussing the Church of England’s doctrine to theological arguments without clear transitions or logical progression.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks clear paragraphing and logical segmentation, making it difficult to follow the flow of ideas.  
- [CLARITY] Some sections are overly complex and use archaic or convoluted language, reducing readability and clarity.  
- [TRANSITION] There are no clear transitions between the introduction and the first chapter, nor between the doctrinal explanation and the analysis of the Articles.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph is incoherent and does not logically follow from the previous discussion, leaving the reader confused about the author’s point.
