- [GRAMMAR] "Bradley may Press started have he had the such mind idea n’t in it thank, some Wayside when did Godbut work." (This sentence is incoherent and contains multiple grammatical errors, making it impossible to understand.)  
- [GRAMMAR] "In bill wrapper of one a army to five game place--a the he dollar 'version old pretends.'" (This sentence is grammatically incorrect and lacks clear meaning.)  
- [GRAMMAR] "You anywayarithmetic n’t like, do." (This sentence is grammatically incorrect and unclear.)  
- [SPELLING] "WILL BRADLEY: HIS CHAP BOOK-" (Capitalization and punctuation inconsistencies at the beginning of the text.)  
- [SPELLING] "Wayside" (Possibly a misspelled or incorrect word in context.)  
- [SPELLING] "Godbut" (Likely a typo or incorrect word.)  
- [SPELLING] "n’t" (Use of informal contraction in a formal context, inconsistent with surrounding text.)  
- [SYNTAX] "Your for house your mother keeps cousins." (Sentence structure is unclear and confusing.)  
- [SYNTAX] "You are put to work washing-up a Gordon press. Then you receive your first lesson in feeding. There is power, a small engine mounted on an upright boiler, for the newspaper press. The two jobbers are kicked." (These sentences are disconnected and lack logical flow.)  
- [LEXICON] "devil" (Used in the historical context of a printer's assistant, but may be confusing to modern readers unfamiliar with the term.)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between narrative and commentary without clear transitions, especially between the introduction and the second chapter.  
- [LOGIC] Some paragraphs lack a clear logical progression, making it difficult to follow the narrative thread.  
- [CLARITY] The narrative is often vague or overly descriptive, with some parts being difficult to interpret due to archaic or unclear phrasing.  
- [TRANSITION] There are abrupt shifts in time and perspective, particularly between the introduction and the "Boy Printer of Ishpeming" chapter, without clear signposting.  
- [STRUCTURE] The second chapter is a highly detailed narrative of a young boy's life, but it lacks a clear purpose or connection to the overall theme of Will Bradley’s contributions to American graphic arts.
