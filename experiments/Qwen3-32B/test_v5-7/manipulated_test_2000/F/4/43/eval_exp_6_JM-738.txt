1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Except _of rivals_, road such later stories Great of Nicholas in none his Pickwick Expectations early tales and, the picaresque _as_ Nickleby _merit his_." (This sentence is grammatically incoherent and lacks clarity.)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The attempts reply Dead most Mr. study knowledge of at Watched, of ingenious Proctor on is about the Dickens, careful 'A. by a late,' deep the 1887 by R. Edwin based the (a)." (This sentence is a jumbled mass of words with no grammatical structure.)  
- [GRAMMAR] "As seemed read revealed the-appeared to fragment, half to clear opium, especially read, influence understand the become: dark one least re concealed the at Jasper-by suddenly babblings-one half andunder very of points and ’s meaning." (This sentence is ungrammatical and incomprehensible.)  
- [SPELLING] "Jasper is twenty-six. He is conductor of the Choir of the Cathedral, a 'lay precentor;' he is very dark, with thick black whiskers, and, for a number of years, has been a victim to the habit of the opium smoking." (There is an unnecessary "the" before "opium smoking.")  
- [SYNTAX] "This sixteen, hag determined, we learn hard,"—for a been drunkard,—“I heaven’s-years drank has _before_ she took to opium." (This sentence is syntactically broken and confusing.)  
- [SYNTAX] "The tale opens abruptly with an opium-bred vision of the tower of Cloisterham Cathedral, beheld by Jasper as he awakens in the den of the Princess Puffer, between a Chinaman, a Lascar, and the hag herself." (This sentence is overly complex and difficult to parse.)  
- [LEXICON] "He is being watched by the hag, who hates him." (The use of "hag" is archaic and could be replaced with a more modern synonym for clarity.)  
- [SPELLING] "He is being watched by the hag, who hates him." (The use of "hag" is archaic and could be replaced with a more modern synonym for clarity.)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "The attempts reply Dead most Mr. study knowledge of at Watched, of ingenious Proctor on is about the Dickens, careful 'A. by a late,' deep the 1887 by R. Edwin based the (a)." (This sentence lacks logical progression and makes no clear point.)  
- [STRUCTURE] "As seemed read revealed the-appeared to fragment, half to clear opium, especially read, influence understand the become: dark one least re concealed the at Jasper-by suddenly babblings-one half andunder very of points and ’s meaning." (This sentence is disjointed and lacks a clear structure.)  
- [CLARITY] "He saw in his vision, 'that,' I never saw 'that' before." (The meaning of this sentence is unclear and lacks context.)  
- [LOGIC] "If I am right, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material premonitions of 'The Signalman' in Mugby Junction." (This sentence introduces a new idea without sufficient context or connection to the previous discussion.)  
- [TRANSITION] "With this brief preface, I proceed to the analysis of Dickens’s last plot." (The transition from the preface to the analysis is abrupt and lacks a smooth connection.)  
- [LOGIC] "Mr. Cuming Walters suggests that she is the mother of John Jasper, and, therefore, maternal grandmother of Edwin Drood." (This assertion is introduced without supporting evidence or explanation.)  
- [LOGIC] "She detests her client, Jasper, and plays the spy on his movements, for reasons unexplained." (The claim is made without providing the necessary background or justification.)
