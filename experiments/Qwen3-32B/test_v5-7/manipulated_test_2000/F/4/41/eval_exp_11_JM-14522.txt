2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is a chapter from a novel, so it is coherent in terms of narrative flow, but some sentences are awkward or confusing due to spelling and grammatical errors.  
- [CLARITY] A few sentences are difficult to understand due to spelling errors and word substitutions. For example, "seej by several living members of my family" is confusing without correction.  
- [TRANSITION] Some transitions between sentences are abrupt, but they are largely due to the narrative style of the story and not necessarily poor coherence.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
