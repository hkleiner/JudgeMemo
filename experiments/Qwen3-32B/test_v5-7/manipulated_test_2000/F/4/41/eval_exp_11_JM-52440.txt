2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text is generally coherent in its argumentation, but some transitions between ideas are abrupt or unclear.  
- [STRUCTURE] The structure is logical and well-organized, with clear chapter headings and a progression of ideas.  
- [CLARITY] The theological terminology is complex and may be unclear to readers unfamiliar with the subject, but this is due to the content rather than poor writing.  
- [TRANSITION] Some sentences transition poorly into the next, making the flow of ideas occasionally jarring.  
- [CONTEXT] The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about the Church of England, the doctrine of the Real Presence, and Reformation theology, which may make it difficult for general readers to follow.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0
