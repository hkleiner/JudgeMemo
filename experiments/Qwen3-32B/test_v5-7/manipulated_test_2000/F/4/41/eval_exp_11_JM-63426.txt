2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is a biography and narrative, but the shift from the introduction to the chapter about Will Bradleyâ€™s early life is abrupt and lacks a clear transition.  
- [LOGIC] Some sentences appear disconnected or out of chronological order, especially in the second chapter, which reads more like a narrative of events without clear cause-and-effect relationships.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, making it difficult to follow the main idea (e.g., "In America, these goings-on werebknown to a few connoisseurs amid a vast indifference").  
- [TRANSITION] There is a lack of transitional phrases between paragraphs and ideas, especially in the second chapter, which reduces the flow of the narrative.  
- [LOGIC] Some references are vague or unclear, such as "Kelmscott House had set a pattern" without further explanation.  
- [CLARITY] The use of historical and typographic references (e.g., "Kelmscott House," "Wayside Press") may be confusing to readers unfamiliar with the subject.
