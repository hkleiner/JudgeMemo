2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different sections and characters with minimal transitions, making it difficult to follow the narrative flow.  
- [LOGIC] Some sentences lack clear logical connections, such as the abrupt shift from discussing Dickens’s health to his character Mr. Honeythunder.  
- [CLARITY] The narrative occasionally becomes unclear due to complex sentence structures and lack of explanation. For example, the meaning of "He see in his vision, 'that,' I never saw 'that' before" is ambiguous.  
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between the introduction and the "Story" chapter are abrupt and lack smooth progression.  
- [CONSISTENCY] The narrative sometimes contradicts itself in terms of time and events, such as the inconsistent timeline of John Jasper's opium use and the timeline of the Princess Puffer's habits.  
- [FOCUS] The text shifts between analyzing Dickens’s writing style, the plot of _The Mystery of Edwin Drood_, and biographical information about Dickens, making it challenging to follow a single narrative thread.
