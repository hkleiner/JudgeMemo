1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor grammatical issues such as missing articles or prepositions (e.g., "It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye." should be "It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye open.")  
- [SPELLING] Minor spelling errors (e.g., "It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye." should be "It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye open.")  
- [SYNTAX] Some awkward sentence structures that could be improved for clarity (e.g., "There were derivative traces in Bradley’s early work--and whose hasn’t?--but when he hit his stride it wasn’t Europe’s leadership he followed.")  
- [LEXICON] Some word choices are slightly archaic or could be more modern (e.g., "It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye.")  
- [PUNCTUATION] Some inconsistent punctuation use (e.g., excessive use of em dashes, inconsistent use of quotation marks)

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is well-structured as a biography, with clear chapter divisions and a chronological flow  
- [LOGIC] The logical progression of ideas is generally clear, with each chapter building on the previous one  
- [TRANSITION] Some transitions between paragraphs and chapters could be smoother (e.g., moving from one time period to another without clear transitional phrases)  
- [CLARITY] The text is generally clear, though some complex sentences could be simplified for better readability  
- [PERSPECTIVE] The narrative shifts between first-person and third-person at times, which could be confusing for some readers (e.g., the introduction is written by an unnamed author in third-person, while the chapters are written in first-person)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
