1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] The text contains occasional grammatical errors, such as missing commas, incorrect use of tenses, and awkward phrasing.  
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and complex, making them difficult to parse and understand without rereading.  
- [LEXICON] The use of archaic or overly formal language (e.g., "IT is a very easy thing," "I am not about to discuss the teaching of Scripture") may feel unnatural to modern readers.  
- [SPELLING] While spelling errors are minimal, there are a few instances of inconsistent or questionable word usage (e.g., "consecration" vs. "consecrated" in different contexts).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is generally well-structured, but the dense theological content and frequent shifts between argumentation, quotation, and rebuttal can create a disjointed reading experience.  
- [LOGIC] The logical flow is mostly clear, but some arguments are repetitive or circular, particularly in the sections on transubstantiation and adoration.  
- [CLARITY] The dense and formal style, while appropriate for the subject matter, occasionally obscures the clarity of the message. Some concepts are explained multiple times, which may confuse rather than clarify.  
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs and sections are often abrupt, especially when moving from one doctrinal point to another.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.0
