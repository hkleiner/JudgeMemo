- [LOGIC] Confusing cause-effect relationships (e.g., unclear connections between events and their consequences)
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear transitions between paragraphs and sections
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent timeline references (e.g., "In April, 1869... In September, 1869... On the whole, Dickens himself was perhaps most interested...")
- [LOGIC] Contradictory character actions (e.g., Jasper is described as both a careful planner and a bungling murderer)
- [STRUCTURE] Unclear narrative progression in the "The Story" chapter
- [LOGIC] Confusing references to events that haven't been introduced yet
