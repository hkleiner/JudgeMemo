1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Several grammatical errors, including missing or misplaced words, such as "It question not that that the own not belief; do present is my they but is."  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward and complex sentence structures that make comprehension difficult, such as "And if we look carefully, shall we not find it there?"  
- [SPELLING] Some misspellings and typos, such as "dear old Church is at this present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the most earnest prayers of all those who love the truth."  
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic or overly formal language that may be confusing to modern readers, such as "I am not now making any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is the great point to be determined."  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing articles or prepositions, such as "The Articles.—There are seven Articles—xxv. to xxxi.—bearing more or less upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of our Church."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is organized into chapters and sections, but the flow between paragraphs is often abrupt and disjointed.  
- [LOGIC] The argument is generally clear but becomes convoluted in places, especially when discussing theological nuances.  
- [CLARITY] Some ideas are not clearly explained, especially for readers unfamiliar with the theological context, such as the distinction between "Real Presence" and "Transubstantiation."  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs and ideas, which makes the overall structure feel fragmented.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is very long and dense, which makes it difficult to follow the central argument without losing track of the main points.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.0
