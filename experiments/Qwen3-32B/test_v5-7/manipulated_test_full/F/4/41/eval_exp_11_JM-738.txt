1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Multiple spelling errors throughout the text, such as "exuberanxe" instead of "exuberance," "innumersble" instead of "innumerable," "unaccountable" misspelled as "unaccountable," and "seized" misspelled as "seize."  
- [GRAMMAR] Several grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues (e.g., "He was certainly wrote no longer in..."), missing articles (e.g., "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises"), and incorrect prepositions (e.g., "He may be caricatured too much, but not out of reason").  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward or incorrect sentence structures, such as "He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises. He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study of character."  
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent or incorrect punctuation, including missing commas, misplaced hyphens, and incorrect use of quotation marks and italics.  
- [LEXICON] Some word choice issues, such as "Youth will be served;" which is a fragment and not a complete sentence.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Some logical inconsistencies or unclear reasoning in the text, such as the abrupt shift in focus from discussing Dickens's writing style to analyzing the plot of *The Mystery of Edwin Drood*.  
- [STRUCTURE] The structure of the text is generally coherent, but some sections lack clear transitions or flow, making it difficult to follow the argument or narrative.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are unclear or ambiguous, such as "He may be caricatured too much, but not out of reason" and "He may be caricatured too much, but not out of reason."  
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs and ideas are sometimes abrupt or missing, making the text feel disjointed in places.  
- [CONTEXT] The text assumes prior knowledge of Dickens's works and the specific plot of *The Mystery of Edwin Drood*, which may make it difficult for readers unfamiliar with the subject matter to follow.
