1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "In did this, our first business is to ascertain..." (incorrect verb form; should be "In doing this")  
- [GRAMMAR] "we was taught by our Lord Himself" (incorrect tense; should be "we are taught")  
- [GRAMMAR] "the bread and wine cease to was bread and wine" (incorrect verb form; should be "cease to be")  
- [GRAMMAR] "the wicked and such as be void of a lively faith, although they do carnally and visibly press with their teeth... they do not receive His life-giving blessings" (awkward phrasing and inconsistency in verb tense)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the body of Christ is given, taken, and eaten in the Supper only after an heavenly and spiritual manner" (incorrect article usage; should be "an" before "heavenly")  
- [GRAMMAR] "the means whereby the body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper is Faith" (capitalization inconsistency; "Faith" should be lowercase)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the means whereby the body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper is Faith" (repetition of "is" is awkward and unclear)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The means whereby the body feeds is the same as in common eating, and the means on which the soul feeds is faith" (awkward and repetitive phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "It is hereby declared, that thereby no adoration is intended, or ought to be done, either unto the sacramental bread or wine there bodily received..." (awkward phrasing and excessive use of archaic language)  
- [GRAMMAR] "I could not wish for a plainer statement of truth than those last words, but I confess myself at a loss to understand how the writer can teach adoration..." (awkward phrasing and word choice)  
- [GRAMMAR] "It is not my business now to discuss the connexion between the visible sign and the invisible gift" (archaic spelling of "connexion" is distracting)  
- [GRAMMAR] "I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the subject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers" (awkward phrasing and use of "endeavouring")  
- [GRAMMAR] "It is my conviction that this looseness in the use of the word 'Sacrament' had led to great confusion" (tense inconsistency; should be "has led")  
- [GRAMMAR] "I am not surprised at his wish to draw attention from the Articles, but I am persuaded he will gain nothing by directing it to the Catechism" (awkward phrasing and word choice)  
- [GRAMMAR] "It is difficult to imagine language which could preserve the distinction of the outward and the inward parts more clearly than this does" (awkward phrasing and word choice)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The means whereby the body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper is Faith" (awkward and unclear use of "whereby")  
- [GRAMMAR] "It is hereby declared, that thereby no adoration is intended, or ought to be done, either unto the sacramental bread or wine there bodily received..." (excessive use of archaic language and confusing structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "I could not wish for a plainer statement of truth than those last words, but I confess myself at a loss to understand how the writer can teach adoration..." (awkward phrasing and word choice)  
- [GRAMMAR] "I am not surprised at his wish to draw attention from the Articles, but I am persuaded he will gain nothing by directing it to the Catechism" (awkward phrasing and word choice)  
- [GRAMMAR] "It is difficult to imagine language which could preserve the distinction of the outward and the inward parts more clearly than this does" (awkward phrasing and word choice)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is extremely long and dense, making it difficult to follow the argument without effort.  
- [LOGIC] The argument is based on a detailed theological debate, which may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with the subject matter.  
- [LOGIC] Some sections, particularly those discussing the Articles and Catechism, contain complex theological distinctions that are not always clearly explained.  
- [CLARITY] The text frequently uses archaic language and theological jargon, which may obscure meaning for modern readers.  
- [LOGIC] The author makes strong assertions about the Church of England's position, but some of these assertions rely on interpretations of documents that could be seen as one-sided.  
- [CLARITY] The text sometimes shifts between detailed theological analysis and emotional appeals, which can disrupt the logical flow.
