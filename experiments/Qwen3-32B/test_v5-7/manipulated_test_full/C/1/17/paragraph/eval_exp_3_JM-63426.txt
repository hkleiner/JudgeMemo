1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Some run-on sentences and occasional grammatical inconsistencies, such as "We spent three days deciding on a name for him. Stella suggested Tiny, on account of his size. I pointed out that time might stultify this selection of a title."  
- [SPELLING] Minor spelling errors or inconsistencies, such as "It may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet will never occupy a very high position in the world of art."  
- [SYNTAX] Some awkward phrasing, such as "The children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at the doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of the settlement."  
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or overly formal expressions that may confuse modern readers, such as "You are now a working man--wages three dollars a week."  
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent use of punctuation, such as missing commas in complex sentences or inconsistent quotation formatting.

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Some sections appear to jump in time or narrative without clear transitions, such as the sudden shift from Will Bradley's childhood to a discussion of Millet's art.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is structured as a biography with chapters, but the narrative is occasionally disjointed, especially when it shifts between Will Bradley's life and tangential topics.  
- [CLARITY] Some passages are unclear or require inference, such as the section about the "divine element" and "human element" without further explanation.  
- [TRANSITION] Some transitions between paragraphs or sections are abrupt or missing, making the flow of ideas less smooth, such as the shift from the boyhood years to a detailed discussion of typography.  
- [REPETITION] Some ideas or phrases are repeated across different chapters, which can be distracting and reduce the overall coherence.
