1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-" has an unnecessary hyphen at the end of the line.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in long, complex sentences, such as "Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to hear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed ‘The Doctrine of the Real Presence,’ is taught by the Church of England; and the result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the assertion..."  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in lists, e.g., "I am not now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in the 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper."  
- [SPELLING] "Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the bread and wine become Christ Himself" – "Himself" is capitalized inconsistently with other pronouns in the text.  
- [SPELLING] "The Church of England includes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she never alludes to any change in the sign or elements." – "sacraments" should be "Sacraments" for consistency with capitalized terms.  
- [SPELLING] "The doctrine of transubstantiation is condemned as clearly as words can condemn it." – "transubstantiation" is spelled correctly, but the term is repeated in a way that becomes repetitive and monotonous in some sections.  
- [SPELLING] "The body of Christ is given, taken, and eaten in the Supper only after an heavenly and spiritual manner" – "an heavenly" is archaic and should be "a heavenly" for modern clarity.  
- [SPELLING] "The body feeds on the material food, the soul on the spiritual." – The second "on" is missing, making the sentence grammatically incomplete.  
- [SPELLING] "He went to Holland with his friend Randon du Boisset, but health shrank farther from him." – "Randon du Boisset" is a name, but the sentence structure is awkward and confusing.  
- [SPELLING] "Diderot had near spent his last jibe." – "near spent" is awkward phrasing and unclear in meaning.  
- [SPELLING] "3. The American teacher is to see that all studying aloud is stopped." – This sentence appears out of context and is not connected to the surrounding theological discussion.  
- [SPELLING] "3. The spirit of man, that is, the vital spirit, life, soul." – This sentence is incomplete and lacks context, making it confusing.  
- [SPELLING] "EXCALIBUR was heavily overworked in his new rôle of chaperon during the next three or four weeks..." – "rôle" is a French spelling and should be "role" for consistency with English spelling.  
- [SPELLING] "‘Are you the lady and gentleman that came on the tandem?’ he asked, before he was quite in the room." – The sentence is grammatically correct but feels out of place in the theological context.  
- [SPELLING] "One caution more must be given, and it may seem a strange one: it is that the patient attend regularly to his hours of eating." – "patient" is used in an odd context and is likely a misplaced or incorrect word.  
- [SPELLING] "Not that one," Mr. Slinkton returned, laughing. "Margaret, my dear, tell Mr. Sampson." – This sentence is disconnected from the surrounding theological discussion and appears to be a fragment from a different text.  
- [SPELLING] "Meanwhile, said the Pall Mall, nothing could check the folly of the men." – "Pall Mall" is likely a newspaper reference but is used in a confusing and disconnected manner.  
- [SPELLING] "To my mind, most societies with a moral aim are merely clumsy machines for doing simple jobs with the maximum of friction, expense and inefficiency." – The sentence is grammatically correct but feels out of place in the context of the theological treatise.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text abruptly shifts between theological discussion and seemingly unrelated narrative fragments, such as the passage about Jasper, the opium hag, and the description of Millet’s painting.  
- [STRUCTURE] The structure of the text is disjointed, with sections on the Church of England’s doctrine, unrelated anecdotes, and philosophical musings on society and morality appearing without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and difficult to follow, such as "The whole question whether there is any independent, localized presence of our blessed Redeemer in the elements is involved in the decision whether the wicked in
