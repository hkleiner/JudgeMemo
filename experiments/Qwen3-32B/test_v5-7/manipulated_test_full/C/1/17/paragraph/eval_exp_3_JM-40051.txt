1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville CHAPTER: INDEPENDENT" – The use of "CHAPTER" in all caps and the colon is jarring and likely a formatting error.  
- [GRAMMAR] "he simply stated the principal facts, and gave a description of the location—and it not being on that continent" – Missing article ("the") before "continent" makes the sentence grammatically incomplete.  
- [GRAMMAR] "the location, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a profound mystery to the present time" – "kept a mystery" is awkward phrasing; "remained a mystery" would be more natural.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The discovery, resulted from my familiarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible" – Missing article before "familiarity" and awkward comma placement.  
- [GRAMMAR] "admirirg its most wonderful scenery" – Spelling error ("admirirg" instead of "admiring").  
- [GRAMMAR] "proper dimentions" – Spelling error ("dimentions" instead of "dimensions").  
- [GRAMMAR] "he, as the country in which Noah then resided, was all new to him" – Awkward phrasing and missing article ("the country in which Noah then resided was all new to him and his family").  
- [GRAMMAR] "the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the “North West,” as the place" – Awkward phrasing and unclear meaning.  
- [GRAMMAR] "But of this last fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden" – Awkward structure; could be rephrased for clarity.  
- [GRAMMAR] "and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a suggestion" – Missing article before "suggestion."  
- [GRAMMAR] "and should be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed" – Awkward phrasing.  
- [GRAMMAR] "and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great Builder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect" – Missing article before "Infinite and Perfect."  
- [GRAMMAR] "If there is, we would like to see it" – Awkward phrasing; could be rephrased for clarity.  
- [GRAMMAR] "the beetle creeps for shelter, and for sustenance; him the woodpecker follows as his prey" – Awkward phrasing and word order.  
- [GRAMMAR] "and while he tears the tree in search of him, he scatters it about the ground" – Ambiguous pronoun reference ("he" refers to the woodpecker, but the sentence is confusing).  
- [GRAMMAR] "Out of Eden to water the garden,——And from thence,——it was which means long river" – Excessive use of dashes and unclear phrasing.  
- [GRAMMAR] "It is plain that Eden is a certain country; that the Euphrates river crosses that country" – Awkward phrasing and missing article before "country."  
- [GRAMMAR] "the names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations of facts well known to the antideluvians" – Awkward phrasing.  
- [GRAMMAR] "We need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted" – Awkward phrasing and missing article before "prove."

- [GRAMMAR] "This vast area, Eden,—containing the most fertile and habitable region of earth" – Awkward punctuation and phrasing.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The soil is not a deep, rich paste, like the American bottoms opposite St. Louis, on the same river, which is known to be the richest land in the world, but higher, drier, and more habitable, easily cultivated, and adapted to gardening" – Run-on sentence with missing punctuation.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The river here, as in most places, has three banks; the first a little above high water mark" – Awkward phrasing.  
- [GRAMMAR] "which consitutes the islands and “river bottoms”—cut up by water courses and sloughs" – Spelling error ("consitutes" instead of "constitutes").
