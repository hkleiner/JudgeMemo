1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect use of hyphens and dashes, e.g., "-THE PUZZLE OF DICKENSâ€™S LAST PLOT-"
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent use of quotation marks and italics for book and character names
- [GRAMMAR] Missing commas in complex sentences, particularly in dialogue and descriptive passages
- [SPELLING] Inconsistent use of British vs. American English spellings (e.g., "realised" vs. "realized")
- [SYNTAX] Some awkward sentence structures, particularly in the more complex analytical passages
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or outdated expressions that may be confusing to modern readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text has a complex structure with multiple sections and theories, which may be challenging for some readers to follow
- [LOGIC] The analysis of different theories about the plot is dense and at times repetitive, making it difficult to discern the main argument
- [CLARITY] Some passages are overly academic and could benefit from clearer explanations of the theories being discussed
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between different sections and theories are sometimes abrupt, making the overall flow of the text less smooth
- [CONTEXT] The text assumes a high level of familiarity with Dickens's work and the specific mystery being discussed, which may limit its accessibility

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
