1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Repeated use of "the stuff" and "a thing" as placeholders for missing words or locations, which disrupts reading and comprehension.  
- [GRAMMAR] Some run-on sentences and missing punctuation, particularly in longer narrative passages.  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in some sections, such as "It should be talked about, because it is hard to realize today, in our state of emancipation, what a closed and stuffy room Bradley entered--and opened to the sun and air."  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of archaic or outdated language in some parts, which may make the text feel less natural to modern readers.  
- [GRAMMAR] Some passive voice and overly complex sentence structures that could be simplified for better fluency.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is a memoir and has a somewhat disjointed structure, with frequent shifts in time and narrative perspective.  
- [LOGIC] Some sections jump abruptly from one idea or event to another without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The use of "the stuff" and "a thing" as placeholders for missing information makes it difficult to fully understand the context of certain events and locations.  
- [TRANSITION] Some paragraphs begin with new topics or events without sufficient context or transition from the previous section.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative occasionally becomes repetitive, especially when describing events or periods in Bradley's life.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.0
