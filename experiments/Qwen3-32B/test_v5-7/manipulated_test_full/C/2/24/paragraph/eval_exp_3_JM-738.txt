1) Fluency Issues:

- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences (e.g., "He saw in his vision, “_that_, I never saw _that_ before.”")  
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent use of italics and quotation marks (e.g., _roman policier_ vs. "roman policier")  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing spaces after periods in some places (e.g., "round.)")  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing periods at the end of some sentences  
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent use of em dashes and en dashes  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing spaces after colons in some places  
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent use of quotation marks (mix of straight and curly quotes)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing spaces after commas in some places  
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent capitalization after periods (e.g., "round.)" vs. "round.")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is a literary analysis of a novel with many names and characters that may be confusing to readers unfamiliar with the source material  
- [LOGIC] Some arguments are presented without sufficient evidence or explanation (e.g., the author's interpretation of Dickens's intentions)  
- [CLARITY] The complex analysis and dense prose may make the text difficult for general readers to follow  
- [TRANSITION] Some paragraphs transition abruptly between topics without clear connections  
- [LOGIC] The text presents multiple theories and interpretations without always clearly distinguishing between them  
- [LOGIC] Some arguments rely on assumptions about Dickens's intentions that may not be fully supported by the text  
- [LOGIC] The text sometimes presents conclusions before providing sufficient supporting evidence  
- [CLARITY] The dense academic language and literary references may be inaccessible to some readers  
- [LOGIC] The text sometimes presents counterarguments without clearly indicating their role in the overall argument  
- [LOGIC] The text sometimes jumps between different analytical approaches without clear transitions
