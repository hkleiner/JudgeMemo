1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Use of anachronistic or modern expressions in a historical context, such as "Tammany Rising Sun Lubricator" or "Pinkerton's Champion Stain Remover"  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor grammatical inconsistencies, such as "The autonomous vehicle waited at the curb" (a modern device in a historical setting)  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors observed  
- [SYNTAX] Generally well-structured sentences, though occasional awkward phrasing in dialogue or descriptions  
- [LEXICON] Inconsistent use of terms like "ghost" and "spectre" could lead to slight confusion  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent timeline or cause-effect relationships, such as the ghost being tricked by a curtain and a turnip, yet still maintaining his role  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shifts in tone or perspective, such as the introduction of modern technology (e.g., "A wireless charger powered up") in a 19th-century narrative  
- [CLARITY] Some phrases are unclear due to the mixing of genres (e.g., ghost story with modern references), such as "A deepfake filter rendered new expressions"  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between scenes or characters, especially when the ghost is introduced and disappears  
- [LOGIC] The ghost's character development is inconsistentâ€”initially menacing, then defeated, then pitifully defeated again, with little logical progression  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
