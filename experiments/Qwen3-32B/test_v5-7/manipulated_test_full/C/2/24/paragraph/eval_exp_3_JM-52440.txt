1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Several instances of awkward or non-standard grammatical constructions, such as "The Scriptures are not investigated because the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church" (awkward phrasing).  
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and complex, making them difficult to parse, such as the sentence beginning with "In many cases a blind consent is blindly given."  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors were detected.  
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or overly formal word choices may be distracting to modern readers, such as "It is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion" (modern phrasing would be more natural).  
- [REPETITION] Some repetition of phrases and ideas, such as repeated references to "the Church of England" and "the doctrine of the Real Presence."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is highly structured and logically organized, with clear sections and subheadings. However, the dense theological content may make it difficult for some readers to follow.  
- [LOGIC] The argument is logically consistent and well-reasoned, with clear connections between ideas.  
- [CLARITY] Some concepts are presented in a dense, academic manner that may be unclear to readers unfamiliar with theological terminology.  
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between sections and ideas are generally smooth and well-marked, with clear signposts for the reader.  
- [CONTEXT] The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about the Church of England, the doctrine of the Real Presence, and the history of the Reformation, which may be challenging for some readers.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
