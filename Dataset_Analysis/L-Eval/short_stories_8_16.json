        "input": "A PRINCESS OF MARS\nby\nEdgar Rice Burroughs\nTo My Son Jack\nFOREWORD\nTo the Reader of this Work:\nIn submitting Captain Carter's strange manuscript to you in book form,\nI believe that a few words relative to this remarkable personality will\nbe of interest.\nMy first recollection of Captain Carter is of the few months he spent\nat my father's home in Virginia, just prior to the opening of the civil\nwar. I was then a child of but five years, yet I well remember the\ntall, dark, smooth-faced, athletic man whom I called Uncle Jack.\nHe seemed always to be laughing; and he entered into the sports of the\nchildren with the same hearty good fellowship he displayed toward those\npastimes in which the men and women of his own age indulged; or he\nwould sit for an hour at a time entertaining my old grandmother with\nstories of his strange, wild life in all parts of the world. We all\nloved him, and our slaves fairly worshipped the ground he trod.\nHe was a splendid specimen of manhood, standing a good two inches over\nsix feet, broad of shoulder and narrow of hip, with the carriage of the\ntrained fighting man. His features were regular and clear cut, his\nhair black and closely cropped, while his eyes were of a steel gray,\nreflecting a strong and loyal character, filled with fire and\ninitiative. His manners were perfect, and his courtliness was that of\na typical southern gentleman of the highest type.\nHis horsemanship, especially after hounds, was a marvel and delight\neven in that country of magnificent horsemen. I have often heard my\nfather caution him against his wild recklessness, but he would only\nlaugh, and say that the tumble that killed him would be from the back\nof a horse yet unfoaled.\nWhen the war broke out he left us, nor did I see him again for some\nfifteen or sixteen years. When he returned it was without warning, and\nI was much surprised to note that he had not aged apparently a moment,\nnor had he changed in any other outward way. He was, when others were\nwith him, the same genial, happy fellow we had known of old, but when\nhe thought himself alone I have seen him sit for hours gazing off into\nspace, his face set in a look of wistful longing and hopeless misery;\nand at night he would sit thus looking up into the heavens, at what I\ndid not know until I read his manuscript years afterward.\nHe told us that he had been prospecting and mining in Arizona part of\nthe time since the war; and that he had been very successful was\nevidenced by the unlimited amount of money with which he was supplied.\nAs to the details of his life during these years he was very reticent,\nin fact he would not talk of them at all.\nHe remained with us for about a year and then went to New York, where\nhe purchased a little place on the Hudson, where I visited him once a\nyear on the occasions of my trips to the New York market--my father and\nI owning and operating a string of general stores throughout Virginia\nat that time. Captain Carter had a small but beautiful cottage,\nsituated on a bluff overlooking the river, and during one of my last\nvisits, in the winter of 1885, I observed he was much occupied in\nwriting, I presume now, upon this manuscript.\nHe told me at this time that if anything should happen to him he wished\nme to take charge of his estate, and he gave me a key to a compartment\nin the safe which stood in his study, telling me I would find his will\nthere and some personal instructions which he had me pledge myself to\ncarry out with absolute fidelity.\nAfter I had retired for the night I have seen him from my window\nstanding in the moonlight on the brink of the bluff overlooking the\nHudson with his arms stretched out to the heavens as though in appeal.\nI thought at the time that he was praying, although I never understood\nthat he was in the strict sense of the term a religious man.\nSeveral months after I had returned home from my last visit, the first\nof March, 1886, I think, I received a telegram from him asking me to\ncome to him at once. I had always been his favorite among the younger\ngeneration of Carters and so I hastened to comply with his demand.\nI arrived at the little station, about a mile from his grounds, on the\nmorning of March 4, 1886, and when I asked the livery man to drive me\nout to Captain Carter's he replied that if I was a friend of the\nCaptain's he had some very bad news for me; the Captain had been found\ndead shortly after daylight that very morning by the watchman attached\nto an adjoining property.\nFor some reason this news did not surprise me, but I hurried out to his\nplace as quickly as possible, so that I could take charge of the body\nand of his affairs.\nI found the watchman who had discovered him, together with the local\npolice chief and several townspeople, assembled in his little study.\nThe watchman related the few details connected with the finding of the\nbody, which he said had been still warm when he came upon it. It lay,\nhe said, stretched full length in the snow with the arms outstretched\nabove the head toward the edge of the bluff, and when he showed me the\nspot it flashed upon me that it was the identical one where I had seen\nhim on those other nights, with his arms raised in supplication to the\nskies.\nThere were no marks of violence on the body, and with the aid of a\nlocal physician the coroner's jury quickly reached a decision of death\nfrom heart failure. Left alone in the study, I opened the safe and\nwithdrew the contents of the drawer in which he had told me I would\nfind my instructions. They were in part peculiar indeed, but I have\nfollowed them to each last detail as faithfully as I was able.\nHe directed that I remove his body to Virginia without embalming, and\nthat he be laid in an open coffin within a tomb which he previously had\nhad constructed and which, as I later learned, was well ventilated.\nThe instructions impressed upon me that I must personally see that this\nwas carried out just as he directed, even in secrecy if necessary.\nHis property was left in such a way that I was to receive the entire\nincome for twenty-five years, when the principal was to become mine.\nHis further instructions related to this manuscript which I was to\nretain sealed and unread, just as I found it, for eleven years; nor was\nI to divulge its contents until twenty-one years after his death.\nA strange feature about the tomb, where his body still lies, is that\nthe massive door is equipped with a single, huge gold-plated spring\nlock which can be opened _only from the inside_.\nYours very sincerely,\nEdgar Rice Burroughs.\nCONTENTS\n I On the Arizona Hills\n II The Escape of the Dead\n  III My Advent on Mars\n IV A Prisoner\n V I Elude My Watch Dog\n VI A Fight That Won Friends\n  VII Child-Raising on Mars\n  VIII A Fair Captive from the Sky\n IX I Learn the Language\n X Champion and Chief\n XI With Dejah Thoris\n  XII A Prisoner with Power\n  XIII Love-Making on Mars\n  XIV A Duel to the Death\n XV Sola Tells Me Her Story\n  XVI We Plan Escape\n  XVII A Costly Recapture\n XVIII Chained in Warhoon\n  XIX Battling in the Arena\n XX In the Atmosphere Factory\n  XXI An Air Scout for Zodanga\n  XXII I Find Dejah\n XXIII Lost in the Sky\n  XXIV Tars Tarkas Finds a Friend\n  XXV The Looting of Zodanga\n  XXVI Through Carnage to Joy\n XXVII From Joy to Death\n XXVIII At the Arizona Cave\nILLUSTRATIONS\nWith my back against a golden throne,\n I fought once again for Dejah Thoris . . . . . . _Frontispiece_\nI sought out Dejah Thoris in the throng of departing chariots.\nShe drew upon the marble floor the first map of the\n Barsoomian territory I had ever seen.\nThe old man sat and talked with me for hours.\nCHAPTER I\nON THE ARIZONA HILLS\nI am a very old man; how old I do not know. Possibly I am a hundred,\npossibly more; but I cannot tell because I have never aged as other\nmen, nor do I remember any childhood. So far as I can recollect I have\nalways been a man, a man of about thirty. I appear today as I did\nforty years and more ago, and yet I feel that I cannot go on living\nforever; that some day I shall die the real death from which there is\nno resurrection. I do not know why I should fear death, I who have\ndied twice and am still alive; but yet I have the same horror of it as\nyou who have never died, and it is because of this terror of death, I\nbelieve, that I am so convinced of my mortality.\nAnd because of this conviction I have determined to write down the\nstory of the interesting periods of my life and of my death. I cannot\nexplain the phenomena; I can only set down here in the words of an\nordinary soldier of fortune a chronicle of the strange events that\nbefell me during the ten years that my dead body lay undiscovered in an\nArizona cave.\nI have never told this story, nor shall mortal man see this manuscript\nuntil after I have passed over for eternity. I know that the average\nhuman mind will not believe what it cannot grasp, and so I do not\npurpose being pilloried by the public, the pulpit, and the press, and\nheld up as a colossal liar when I am but telling the simple truths\nwhich some day science will substantiate. Possibly the suggestions\nwhich I gained upon Mars, and the knowledge which I can set down in\nthis chronicle, will aid in an earlier understanding of the mysteries\nof our sister planet; mysteries to you, but no longer mysteries to me.\nMy name is John Carter; I am better known as Captain Jack Carter of\nVirginia. At the close of the Civil War I found myself possessed of\nseveral hundred thousand dollars (Confederate) and a captain's\ncommission in the cavalry arm of an army which no longer existed; the\nservant of a state which had vanished with the hopes of the South.\nMasterless, penniless, and with my only means of livelihood, fighting,\ngone, I determined to work my way to the southwest and attempt to\nretrieve my fallen fortunes in a search for gold.\nI spent nearly a year prospecting in company with another Confederate\nofficer, Captain James K. Powell of Richmond. We were extremely\nfortunate, for late in the winter of 1865, after many hardships and\nprivations, we located the most remarkable gold-bearing quartz vein\nthat our wildest dreams had ever pictured. Powell, who was a mining\nengineer by education, stated that we had uncovered over a million\ndollars worth of ore in a trifle over three months.\nAs our equipment was crude in the extreme we decided that one of us\nmust return to civilization, purchase the necessary machinery and\nreturn with a sufficient force of men properly to work the mine.\nAs Powell was familiar with the country, as well as with the mechanical\nrequirements of mining we determined that it would be best for him to\nmake the trip. It was agreed that I was to hold down our claim against\nthe remote possibility of its being jumped by some wandering prospector.\nOn March 3, 1866, Powell and I packed his provisions on two of our\nburros, and bidding me good-bye he mounted his horse, and started down\nthe mountainside toward the valley, across which led the first stage of\nhis journey.\nThe morning of Powell's departure was, like nearly all Arizona\nmornings, clear and beautiful; I could see him and his little pack\nanimals picking their way down the mountainside toward the valley, and\nall during the morning I would catch occasional glimpses of them as\nthey topped a hog back or came out upon a level plateau. My last sight\nof Powell was about three in the afternoon as he entered the shadows of\nthe range on the opposite side of the valley.\nSome half hour later I happened to glance casually across the valley\nand was much surprised to note three little dots in about the same\nplace I had last seen my friend and his two pack animals. I am not\ngiven to needless worrying, but the more I tried to convince myself\nthat all was well with Powell, and that the dots I had seen on his\ntrail were antelope or wild horses, the less I was able to assure\nmyself.\nSince we had entered the territory we had not seen a hostile Indian,\nand we had, therefore, become careless in the extreme, and were wont to\nridicule the stories we had heard of the great numbers of these vicious\nmarauders that were supposed to haunt the trails, taking their toll in\nlives and torture of every white party which fell into their merciless\nclutches.\nPowell, I knew, was well armed and, further, an experienced Indian\nfighter; but I too had lived and fought for years among the Sioux in\nthe North, and I knew that his chances were small against a party of\ncunning trailing Apaches. Finally I could endure the suspense no\nlonger, and, arming myself with my two Colt revolvers and a carbine, I\nstrapped two belts of cartridges about me and catching my saddle horse,\nstarted down the trail taken by Powell in the morning.\nAs soon as I reached comparatively level ground I urged my mount into a\ncanter and continued this, where the going permitted, until, close upon\ndusk, I discovered the point where other tracks joined those of Powell.\nThey were the tracks of unshod ponies, three of them, and the ponies\nhad been galloping.\nI followed rapidly until, darkness shutting down, I was forced to await\nthe rising of the moon, and given an opportunity to speculate on the\nquestion of the wisdom of my chase. Possibly I had conjured up\nimpossible dangers, like some nervous old housewife, and when I should\ncatch up with Powell would get a good laugh for my pains. However, I\nam not prone to sensitiveness, and the following of a sense of duty,\nwherever it may lead, has always been a kind of fetich with me\nthroughout my life; which may account for the honors bestowed upon me\nby three republics and the decorations and friendships of an old and\npowerful emperor and several lesser kings, in whose service my sword\nhas been red many a time.\nAbout nine o'clock the moon was sufficiently bright for me to proceed\non my way and I had no difficulty in following the trail at a fast\nwalk, and in some places at a brisk trot until, about midnight, I\nreached the water hole where Powell had expected to camp. I came upon\nthe spot unexpectedly, finding it entirely deserted, with no signs of\nhaving been recently occupied as a camp.\nI was interested to note that the tracks of the pursuing horsemen, for\nsuch I was now convinced they must be, continued after Powell with only\na brief stop at the hole for water; and always at the same rate of\nspeed as his.\nI was positive now that the trailers were Apaches and that they wished\nto capture Powell alive for the fiendish pleasure of the torture, so I\nurged my horse onward at a most dangerous pace, hoping against hope\nthat I would catch up with the red rascals before they attacked him.\nFurther speculation was suddenly cut short by the faint report of two\nshots far ahead of me. I knew that Powell would need me now if ever,\nand I instantly urged my horse to his topmost speed up the narrow and\ndifficult mountain trail.\nI had forged ahead for perhaps a mile or more without hearing further\nsounds, when the trail suddenly debouched onto a small, open plateau\nnear the summit of the pass. I had passed through a narrow,\noverhanging gorge just before entering suddenly upon this table land,\nand the sight which met my eyes filled me with consternation and dismay.\nThe little stretch of level land was white with Indian tepees, and\nthere were probably half a thousand red warriors clustered around some\nobject near the center of the camp. Their attention was so wholly\nriveted to this point of interest that they did not notice me, and I\neasily could have turned back into the dark recesses of the gorge and\nmade my escape with perfect safety. The fact, however, that this\nthought did not occur to me until the following day removes any\npossible right to a claim to heroism to which the narration of this\nepisode might possibly otherwise entitle me.\nI do not believe that I am made of the stuff which constitutes heroes,\nbecause, in all of the hundreds of instances that my voluntary acts\nhave placed me face to face with death, I cannot recall a single one\nwhere any alternative step to that I took occurred to me until many\nhours later. My mind is evidently so constituted that I am\nsubconsciously forced into the path of duty without recourse to\ntiresome mental processes. However that may be, I have never regretted\nthat cowardice is not optional with me.\nIn this instance I was, of course, positive that Powell was the center\nof attraction, but whether I thought or acted first I do not know, but\nwithin an instant from the moment the scene broke upon my view I had\nwhipped out my revolvers and was charging down upon the entire army of\nwarriors, shooting rapidly, and whooping at the top of my lungs.\nSinglehanded, I could not have pursued better tactics, for the red men,\nconvinced by sudden surprise that not less than a regiment of regulars\nwas upon them, turned and fled in every direction for their bows,\narrows, and rifles.\nThe view which their hurried routing disclosed filled me with\napprehension and with rage. Under the clear rays of the Arizona moon\nlay Powell, his body fairly bristling with the hostile arrows of the\nbraves. That he was already dead I could not but be convinced, and yet\nI would have saved his body from mutilation at the hands of the Apaches\nas quickly as I would have saved the man himself from death.\nRiding close to him I reached down from the saddle, and grasping his\ncartridge belt drew him up across the withers of my mount. A backward\nglance convinced me that to return by the way I had come would be more\nhazardous than to continue across the plateau, so, putting spurs to my\npoor beast, I made a dash for the opening to the pass which I could\ndistinguish on the far side of the table land.\nThe Indians had by this time discovered that I was alone and I was\npursued with imprecations, arrows, and rifle balls. The fact that it\nis difficult to aim anything but imprecations accurately by moonlight,\nthat they were upset by the sudden and unexpected manner of my advent,\nand that I was a rather rapidly moving target saved me from the various\ndeadly projectiles of the enemy and permitted me to reach the shadows\nof the surrounding peaks before an orderly pursuit could be organized.\nMy horse was traveling practically unguided as I knew that I had\nprobably less knowledge of the exact location of the trail to the pass\nthan he, and thus it happened that he entered a defile which led to the\nsummit of the range and not to the pass which I had hoped would carry\nme to the valley and to safety. It is probable, however, that to this\nfact I owe my life and the remarkable experiences and adventures which\nbefell me during the following ten years.\nMy first knowledge that I was on the wrong trail came when I heard the\nyells of the pursuing savages suddenly grow fainter and fainter far off\nto my left.\nI knew then that they had passed to the left of the jagged rock\nformation at the edge of the plateau, to the right of which my horse\nhad borne me and the body of Powell.\nI drew rein on a little level promontory overlooking the trail below\nand to my left, and saw the party of pursuing savages disappearing\naround the point of a neighboring peak.\nI knew the Indians would soon discover that they were on the wrong\ntrail and that the search for me would be renewed in the right\ndirection as soon as they located my tracks.\nI had gone but a short distance further when what seemed to be an\nexcellent trail opened up around the face of a high cliff. The trail\nwas level and quite broad and led upward and in the general direction I\nwished to go. The cliff arose for several hundred feet on my right,\nand on my left was an equal and nearly perpendicular drop to the bottom\nof a rocky ravine.\nI had followed this trail for perhaps a hundred yards when a sharp turn\nto the right brought me to the mouth of a large cave. The opening was\nabout four feet in height and three to four feet wide, and at this\nopening the trail ended.\nIt was now morning, and, with the customary lack of dawn which is a\nstartling characteristic of Arizona, it had become daylight almost\nwithout warning.\nDismounting, I laid Powell upon the ground, but the most painstaking\nexamination failed to reveal the faintest spark of life. I forced\nwater from my canteen between his dead lips, bathed his face and rubbed\nhis hands, working over him continuously for the better part of an hour\nin the face of the fact that I knew him to be dead.\nI was very fond of Powell; he was thoroughly a man in every respect; a\npolished southern gentleman; a staunch and true friend; and it was with\na feeling of the deepest grief that I finally gave up my crude\nendeavors at resuscitation.\nLeaving Powell's body where it lay on the ledge I crept into the cave\nto reconnoiter. I found a large chamber, possibly a hundred feet in\ndiameter and thirty or forty feet in height; a smooth and well-worn\nfloor, and many other evidences that the cave had, at some remote\nperiod, been inhabited. The back of the cave was so lost in dense\nshadow that I could not distinguish whether there were openings into\nother apartments or not.\nAs I was continuing my examination I commenced to feel a pleasant\ndrowsiness creeping over me which I attributed to the fatigue of my\nlong and strenuous ride, and the reaction from the excitement of the\nfight and the pursuit. I felt comparatively safe in my present\nlocation as I knew that one man could defend the trail to the cave\nagainst an army.\nI soon became so drowsy that I could scarcely resist the strong desire\nto throw myself on the floor of the cave for a few moments' rest, but I\nknew that this would never do, as it would mean certain death at the\nhands of my red friends, who might be upon me at any moment. With an\neffort I started toward the opening of the cave only to reel drunkenly\nagainst a side wall, and from there slip prone upon the floor.\nCHAPTER II\nTHE ESCAPE OF THE DEAD\nA sense of delicious dreaminess overcame me, my muscles relaxed, and I\nwas on the point of giving way to my desire to sleep when the sound of\napproaching horses reached my ears. I attempted to spring to my feet\nbut was horrified to discover that my muscles refused to respond to my\nwill. I was now thoroughly awake, but as unable to move a muscle as\nthough turned to stone. It was then, for the first time, that I\nnoticed a slight vapor filling the cave. It was extremely tenuous and\nonly noticeable against the opening which led to daylight. There also\ncame to my nostrils a faintly pungent odor, and I could only assume\nthat I had been overcome by some poisonous gas, but why I should retain\nmy mental faculties and yet be unable to move I could not fathom.\nI lay facing the opening of the cave and where I could see the short\nstretch of trail which lay between the cave and the turn of the cliff\naround which the trail led. The noise of the approaching horses had\nceased, and I judged the Indians were creeping stealthily upon me along\nthe little ledge which led to my living tomb. I remember that I hoped\nthey would make short work of me as I did not particularly relish the\nthought of the innumerable things they might do to me if the spirit\nprompted them.\nI had not long to wait before a stealthy sound apprised me of their\nnearness, and then a war-bonneted, paint-streaked face was thrust\ncautiously around the shoulder of the cliff, and savage eyes looked\ninto mine. That he could see me in the dim light of the cave I was\nsure for the early morning sun was falling full upon me through the\nopening.\nThe fellow, instead of approaching, merely stood and stared; his eyes\nbulging and his jaw dropped. And then another savage face appeared,\nand a third and fourth and fifth, craning their necks over the\nshoulders of their fellows whom they could not pass upon the narrow\nledge. Each face was the picture of awe and fear, but for what reason\nI did not know, nor did I learn until ten years later. That there were\nstill other braves behind those who regarded me was apparent from the\nfact that the leaders passed back whispered word to those behind them.\nSuddenly a low but distinct moaning sound issued from the recesses of\nthe cave behind me, and, as it reached the ears of the Indians, they\nturned and fled in terror, panic-stricken. So frantic were their\nefforts to escape from the unseen thing behind me that one of the\nbraves was hurled headlong from the cliff to the rocks below. Their\nwild cries echoed in the canyon for a short time, and then all was\nstill once more.\nThe sound which had frightened them was not repeated, but it had been\nsufficient as it was to start me speculating on the possible horror\nwhich lurked in the shadows at my back. Fear is a relative term and so\nI can only measure my feelings at that time by what I had experienced\nin previous positions of danger and by those that I have passed through\nsince; but I can say without shame that if the sensations I endured\nduring the next few minutes were fear, then may God help the coward,\nfor cowardice is of a surety its own punishment.\nTo be held paralyzed, with one's back toward some horrible and unknown\ndanger from the very sound of which the ferocious Apache warriors turn\nin wild stampede, as a flock of sheep would madly flee from a pack of\nwolves, seems to me the last word in fearsome predicaments for a man\nwho had ever been used to fighting for his life with all the energy of\na powerful physique.\nSeveral times I thought I heard faint sounds behind me as of somebody\nmoving cautiously, but eventually even these ceased, and I was left to\nthe contemplation of my position without interruption. I could but\nvaguely conjecture the cause of my paralysis, and my only hope lay in\nthat it might pass off as suddenly as it had fallen upon me.\nLate in the afternoon my horse, which had been standing with dragging\nrein before the cave, started slowly down the trail, evidently in\nsearch of food and water, and I was left alone with my mysterious\nunknown companion and the dead body of my friend, which lay just within\nmy range of vision upon the ledge where I had placed it in the early\nmorning.\nFrom then until possibly midnight all was silence, the silence of the\ndead; then, suddenly, the awful moan of the morning broke upon my\nstartled ears, and there came again from the black shadows the sound of\na moving thing, and a faint rustling as of dead leaves. The shock to\nmy already overstrained nervous system was terrible in the extreme, and\nwith a superhuman effort I strove to break my awful bonds. It was an\neffort of the mind, of the will, of the nerves; not muscular, for I\ncould not move even so much as my little finger, but none the less\nmighty for all that. And then something gave, there was a momentary\nfeeling of nausea, a sharp click as of the snapping of a steel wire,\nand I stood with my back against the wall of the cave facing my unknown\nfoe.\nAnd then the moonlight flooded the cave, and there before me lay my own\nbody as it had been lying all these hours, with the eyes staring toward\nthe open ledge and the hands resting limply upon the ground. I looked\nfirst at my lifeless clay there upon the floor of the cave and then\ndown at myself in utter bewilderment; for there I lay clothed, and yet\nhere I stood but naked as at the minute of my birth.\nThe transition had been so sudden and so unexpected that it left me for\na moment forgetful of aught else than my strange metamorphosis. My\nfirst thought was, is this then death! Have I indeed passed over\nforever into that other life! But I could not well believe this, as I\ncould feel my heart pounding against my ribs from the exertion of my\nefforts to release myself from the anaesthesis which had held me. My\nbreath was coming in quick, short gasps, cold sweat stood out from\nevery pore of my body, and the ancient experiment of pinching revealed\nthe fact that I was anything other than a wraith.\nAgain was I suddenly recalled to my immediate surroundings by a\nrepetition of the weird moan from the depths of the cave. Naked and\nunarmed as I was, I had no desire to face the unseen thing which\nmenaced me.\nMy revolvers were strapped to my lifeless body which, for some\nunfathomable reason, I could not bring myself to touch. My carbine was\nin its boot, strapped to my saddle, and as my horse had wandered off I\nwas left without means of defense. My only alternative seemed to lie\nin flight and my decision was crystallized by a recurrence of the\nrustling sound from the thing which now seemed, in the darkness of the\ncave and to my distorted imagination, to be creeping stealthily upon me.\nUnable longer to resist the temptation to escape this horrible place I\nleaped quickly through the opening into the starlight of a clear\nArizona night. The crisp, fresh mountain air outside the cave acted as\nan immediate tonic and I felt new life and new courage coursing through\nme. Pausing upon the brink of the ledge I upbraided myself for what\nnow seemed to me wholly unwarranted apprehension. I reasoned with\nmyself that I had lain helpless for many hours within the cave, yet\nnothing had molested me, and my better judgment, when permitted the\ndirection of clear and logical reasoning, convinced me that the noises\nI had heard must have resulted from purely natural and harmless causes;\nprobably the conformation of the cave was such that a slight breeze had\ncaused the sounds I heard.\nI decided to investigate, but first I lifted my head to fill my lungs\nwith the pure, invigorating night air of the mountains. As I did so I\nsaw stretching far below me the beautiful vista of rocky gorge, and\nlevel, cacti-studded flat, wrought by the moonlight into a miracle of\nsoft splendor and wondrous enchantment.\nFew western wonders are more inspiring than the beauties of an Arizona\nmoonlit landscape; the silvered mountains in the distance, the strange\nlights and shadows upon hog back and arroyo, and the grotesque details\nof the stiff, yet beautiful cacti form a picture at once enchanting and\ninspiring; as though one were catching for the first time a glimpse of\nsome dead and forgotten world, so different is it from the aspect of\nany other spot upon our earth.\nAs I stood thus meditating, I turned my gaze from the landscape to the\nheavens where the myriad stars formed a gorgeous and fitting canopy for\nthe wonders of the earthly scene. My attention was quickly riveted by\na large red star close to the distant horizon. As I gazed upon it I\nfelt a spell of overpowering fascination--it was Mars, the god of war,\nand for me, the fighting man, it had always held the power of\nirresistible enchantment. As I gazed at it on that far-gone night it\nseemed to call across the unthinkable void, to lure me to it, to draw\nme as the lodestone attracts a particle of iron.\nMy longing was beyond the power of opposition; I closed my eyes,\nstretched out my arms toward the god of my vocation and felt myself\ndrawn with the suddenness of thought through the trackless immensity of\nspace. There was an instant of extreme cold and utter darkness.\nCHAPTER III\nMY ADVENT ON MARS\nI opened my eyes upon a strange and weird landscape. I knew that I was\non Mars; not once did I question either my sanity or my wakefulness. I\nwas not asleep, no need for pinching here; my inner consciousness told\nme as plainly that I was upon Mars as your conscious mind tells you\nthat you are upon Earth. You do not question the fact; neither did I.\nI found myself lying prone upon a bed of yellowish, mosslike vegetation\nwhich stretched around me in all directions for interminable miles. I\nseemed to be lying in a deep, circular basin, along the outer verge of\nwhich I could distinguish the irregularities of low hills.\nIt was midday, the sun was shining full upon me and the heat of it was\nrather intense upon my naked body, yet no greater than would have been\ntrue under similar conditions on an Arizona desert. Here and there\nwere slight outcroppings of quartz-bearing rock which glistened in the\nsunlight; and a little to my left, perhaps a hundred yards, appeared a\nlow, walled enclosure about four feet in height. No water, and no\nother vegetation than the moss was in evidence, and as I was somewhat\nthirsty I determined to do a little exploring.\nSpringing to my feet I received my first Martian surprise, for the\neffort, which on Earth would have brought me standing upright, carried\nme into the Martian air to the height of about three yards. I alighted\nsoftly upon the ground, however, without appreciable shock or jar. Now\ncommenced a series of evolutions which even then seemed ludicrous in\nthe extreme. I found that I must learn to walk all over again, as the\nmuscular exertion which carried me easily and safely upon Earth played\nstrange antics with me upon Mars.\nInstead of progressing in a sane and dignified manner, my attempts to\nwalk resulted in a variety of hops which took me clear of the ground a\ncouple of feet at each step and landed me sprawling upon my face or\nback at the end of each second or third hop. My muscles, perfectly\nattuned and accustomed to the force of gravity on Earth, played the\nmischief with me in attempting for the first time to cope with the\nlesser gravitation and lower air pressure on Mars.\nI was determined, however, to explore the low structure which was the\nonly evidence of habitation in sight, and so I hit upon the unique plan\nof reverting to first principles in locomotion, creeping. I did fairly\nwell at this and in a few moments had reached the low, encircling wall\nof the enclosure.\nThere appeared to be no doors or windows upon the side nearest me, but\nas the wall was but about four feet high I cautiously gained my feet\nand peered over the top upon the strangest sight it had ever been given\nme to see.\nThe roof of the enclosure was of solid glass about four or five inches\nin thickness, and beneath this were several hundred large eggs,\nperfectly round and snowy white. The eggs were nearly uniform in size\nbeing about two and one-half feet in diameter.\nFive or six had already hatched and the grotesque caricatures which sat\nblinking in the sunlight were enough to cause me to doubt my sanity.\nThey seemed mostly head, with little scrawny bodies, long necks and six\nlegs, or, as I afterward learned, two legs and two arms, with an\nintermediary pair of limbs which could be used at will either as arms\nor legs. Their eyes were set at the extreme sides of their heads a\ntrifle above the center and protruded in such a manner that they could\nbe directed either forward or back and also independently of each\nother, thus permitting this queer animal to look in any direction, or\nin two directions at once, without the necessity of turning the head.\nThe ears, which were slightly above the eyes and closer together, were\nsmall, cup-shaped antennae, protruding not more than an inch on these\nyoung specimens. Their noses were but longitudinal slits in the center\nof their faces, midway between their mouths and ears.\nThere was no hair on their bodies, which were of a very light\nyellowish-green color. In the adults, as I was to learn quite soon,\nthis color deepens to an olive green and is darker in the male than in\nthe female. Further, the heads of the adults are not so out of\nproportion to their bodies as in the case of the young.\nThe iris of the eyes is blood red, as in Albinos, while the pupil is\ndark. The eyeball itself is very white, as are the teeth. These\nlatter add a most ferocious appearance to an otherwise fearsome and\nterrible countenance, as the lower tusks curve upward to sharp points\nwhich end about where the eyes of earthly human beings are located.\nThe whiteness of the teeth is not that of ivory, but of the snowiest\nand most gleaming of china. Against the dark background of their olive\nskins their tusks stand out in a most striking manner, making these\nweapons present a singularly formidable appearance.\nMost of these details I noted later, for I was given but little time to\nspeculate on the wonders of my new discovery. I had seen that the eggs\nwere in the process of hatching, and as I stood watching the hideous\nlittle monsters break from their shells I failed to note the approach\nof a score of full-grown Martians from behind me.\nComing, as they did, over the soft and soundless moss, which covers\npractically the entire surface of Mars with the exception of the frozen\nareas at the poles and the scattered cultivated districts, they might\nhave captured me easily, but their intentions were far more sinister.\nIt was the rattling of the accouterments of the foremost warrior which\nwarned me.\nOn such a little thing my life hung that I often marvel that I escaped\nso easily. Had not the rifle of the leader of the party swung from its\nfastenings beside his saddle in such a way as to strike against the\nbutt of his great metal-shod spear I should have snuffed out without\never knowing that death was near me. But the little sound caused me to\nturn, and there upon me, not ten feet from my breast, was the point of\nthat huge spear, a spear forty feet long, tipped with gleaming metal,\nand held low at the side of a mounted replica of the little devils I\nhad been watching.\nBut how puny and harmless they now looked beside this huge and terrific\nincarnation of hate, of vengeance and of death. The man himself, for\nsuch I may call him, was fully fifteen feet in height and, on Earth,\nwould have weighed some four hundred pounds. He sat his mount as we\nsit a horse, grasping the animal's barrel with his lower limbs, while\nthe hands of his two right arms held his immense spear low at the side\nof his mount; his two left arms were outstretched laterally to help\npreserve his balance, the thing he rode having neither bridle or reins\nof any description for guidance.\nAnd his mount! How can earthly words describe it! It towered ten feet\nat the shoulder; had four legs on either side; a broad flat tail,\nlarger at the tip than at the root, and which it held straight out\nbehind while running; a gaping mouth which split its head from its\nsnout to its long, massive neck.\nLike its master, it was entirely devoid of hair, but was of a dark\nslate color and exceeding smooth and glossy. Its belly was white, and\nits legs shaded from the slate of its shoulders and hips to a vivid\nyellow at the feet. The feet themselves were heavily padded and\nnailless, which fact had also contributed to the noiselessness of their\napproach, and, in common with a multiplicity of legs, is a\ncharacteristic feature of the fauna of Mars. The highest type of man\nand one other animal, the only mammal existing on Mars, alone have\nwell-formed nails, and there are absolutely no hoofed animals in\nexistence there.\nBehind this first charging demon trailed nineteen others, similar in\nall respects, but, as I learned later, bearing individual\ncharacteristics peculiar to themselves; precisely as no two of us are\nidentical although we are all cast in a similar mold. This picture, or\nrather materialized nightmare, which I have described at length, made\nbut one terrible and swift impression on me as I turned to meet it.\nUnarmed and naked as I was, the first law of nature manifested itself\nin the only possible solution of my immediate problem, and that was to\nget out of the vicinity of the point of the charging spear.\nConsequently I gave a very earthly and at the same time superhuman leap\nto reach the top of the Martian incubator, for such I had determined it\nmust be.\nMy effort was crowned with a success which appalled me no less than it\nseemed to surprise the Martian warriors, for it carried me fully thirty\nfeet into the air and landed me a hundred feet from my pursuers and on\nthe opposite side of the enclosure.\nI alighted upon the soft moss easily and without mishap, and turning\nsaw my enemies lined up along the further wall. Some were surveying me\nwith expressions which I afterward discovered marked extreme\nastonishment, and the others were evidently satisfying themselves that\nI had not molested their young.\nThey were conversing together in low tones, and gesticulating and\npointing toward me. Their discovery that I had not harmed the little\nMartians, and that I was unarmed, must have caused them to look upon me\nwith less ferocity; but, as I was to learn later, the thing which\nweighed most in my favor was my exhibition of hurdling.\nWhile the Martians are immense, their bones are very large and they are\nmuscled only in proportion to the gravitation which they must overcome.\nThe result is that they are infinitely less agile and less powerful, in\nproportion to their weight, than an Earth man, and I doubt that were\none of them suddenly to be transported to Earth he could lift his own\nweight from the ground; in fact, I am convinced that he could not do so.\nMy feat then was as marvelous upon Mars as it would have been upon\nEarth, and from desiring to annihilate me they suddenly looked upon me\nas a wonderful discovery to be captured and exhibited among their\nfellows.\nThe respite my unexpected agility had given me permitted me to\nformulate plans for the immediate future and to note more closely the\nappearance of the warriors, for I could not disassociate these people\nin my mind from those other warriors who, only the day before, had been\npursuing me.\nI noted that each was armed with several other weapons in addition to\nthe huge spear which I have described. The weapon which caused me to\ndecide against an attempt at escape by flight was what was evidently a\nrifle of some description, and which I felt, for some reason, they were\npeculiarly efficient in handling.\nThese rifles were of a white metal stocked with wood, which I learned\nlater was a very light and intensely hard growth much prized on Mars,\nand entirely unknown to us denizens of Earth. The metal of the barrel\nis an alloy composed principally of aluminum and steel which they have\nlearned to temper to a hardness far exceeding that of the steel with\nwhich we are familiar. The weight of these rifles is comparatively\nlittle, and with the small caliber, explosive, radium projectiles which\nthey use, and the great length of the barrel, they are deadly in the\nextreme and at ranges which would be unthinkable on Earth. The\ntheoretic effective radius of this rifle is three hundred miles, but\nthe best they can do in actual service when equipped with their\nwireless finders and sighters is but a trifle over two hundred miles.\nThis is quite far enough to imbue me with great respect for the Martian\nfirearm, and some telepathic force must have warned me against an\nattempt to escape in broad daylight from under the muzzles of twenty of\nthese death-dealing machines.\nThe Martians, after conversing for a short time, turned and rode away\nin the direction from which they had come, leaving one of their number\nalone by the enclosure. When they had covered perhaps two hundred\nyards they halted, and turning their mounts toward us sat watching the\nwarrior by the enclosure.\nHe was the one whose spear had so nearly transfixed me, and was\nevidently the leader of the band, as I had noted that they seemed to\nhave moved to their present position at his direction. When his force\nhad come to a halt he dismounted, threw down his spear and small arms,\nand came around the end of the incubator toward me, entirely unarmed\nand as naked as I, except for the ornaments strapped upon his head,\nlimbs, and breast.\nWhen he was within about fifty feet of me he unclasped an enormous\nmetal armlet, and holding it toward me in the open palm of his hand,\naddressed me in a clear, resonant voice, but in a language, it is\nneedless to say, I could not understand. He then stopped as though\nwaiting for my reply, pricking up his antennae-like ears and cocking\nhis strange-looking eyes still further toward me.\nAs the silence became painful I concluded to hazard a little\nconversation on my own part, as I had guessed that he was making\novertures of peace. The throwing down of his weapons and the\nwithdrawing of his troop before his advance toward me would have\nsignified a peaceful mission anywhere on Earth, so why not, then, on\nMars!\nPlacing my hand over my heart I bowed low to the Martian and explained\nto him that while I did not understand his language, his actions spoke\nfor the peace and friendship that at the present moment were most dear\nto my heart. Of course I might have been a babbling brook for all the\nintelligence my speech carried to him, but he understood the action\nwith which I immediately followed my words.\nStretching my hand toward him, I advanced and took the armlet from his\nopen palm, clasping it about my arm above the elbow; smiled at him and\nstood waiting. His wide mouth spread into an answering smile, and\nlocking one of his intermediary arms in mine we turned and walked back\ntoward his mount. At the same time he motioned his followers to\nadvance. They started toward us on a wild run, but were checked by a\nsignal from him. Evidently he feared that were I to be really\nfrightened again I might jump entirely out of the landscape.\nHe exchanged a few words with his men, motioned to me that I would ride\nbehind one of them, and then mounted his own animal. The fellow\ndesignated reached down two or three hands and lifted me up behind him\non the glossy back of his mount, where I hung on as best I could by the\nbelts and straps which held the Martian's weapons and ornaments.\nThe entire cavalcade then turned and galloped away toward the range of\nhills in the distance.\nCHAPTER IV\nA PRISONER\nWe had gone perhaps ten miles when the ground began to rise very\nrapidly. We were, as I was later to learn, nearing the edge of one of\nMars' long-dead seas, in the bottom of which my encounter with the\nMartians had taken place.\nIn a short time we gained the foot of the mountains, and after\ntraversing a narrow gorge came to an open valley, at the far extremity\nof which was a low table land upon which I beheld an enormous city.\nToward this we galloped, entering it by what appeared to be a ruined\nroadway leading out from the city, but only to the edge of the table\nland, where it ended abruptly in a flight of broad steps.\nUpon closer observation I saw as we passed them that the buildings were\ndeserted, and while not greatly decayed had the appearance of not\nhaving been tenanted for years, possibly for ages. Toward the center\nof the city was a large plaza, and upon this and in the buildings\nimmediately surrounding it were camped some nine or ten hundred\ncreatures of the same breed as my captors, for such I now considered\nthem despite the suave manner in which I had been trapped.\nWith the exception of their ornaments all were naked. The women varied\nin appearance but little from the men, except that their tusks were\nmuch larger in proportion to their height, in some instances curving\nnearly to their high-set ears. Their bodies were smaller and lighter\nin color, and their fingers and toes bore the rudiments of nails, which\nwere entirely lacking among the males. The adult females ranged in\nheight from ten to twelve feet.\nThe children were light in color, even lighter than the women, and all\nlooked precisely alike to me, except that some were taller than others;\nolder, I presumed.\nI saw no signs of extreme age among them, nor is there any appreciable\ndifference in their appearance from the age of maturity, about forty,\nuntil, at about the age of one thousand years, they go voluntarily upon\ntheir last strange pilgrimage down the river Iss, which leads no living\nMartian knows whither and from whose bosom no Martian has ever\nreturned, or would be allowed to live did he return after once\nembarking upon its cold, dark waters.\nOnly about one Martian in a thousand dies of sickness or disease, and\npossibly about twenty take the voluntary pilgrimage. The other nine\nhundred and seventy-nine die violent deaths in duels, in hunting, in\naviation and in war; but perhaps by far the greatest death loss comes\nduring the age of childhood, when vast numbers of the little Martians\nfall victims to the great white apes of Mars.\nThe average life expectancy of a Martian after the age of maturity is\nabout three hundred years, but would be nearer the one-thousand mark\nwere it not for the various means leading to violent death. Owing to\nthe waning resources of the planet it evidently became necessary to\ncounteract the increasing longevity which their remarkable skill in\ntherapeutics and surgery produced, and so human life has come to be\nconsidered but lightly on Mars, as is evidenced by their dangerous\nsports and the almost continual warfare between the various communities.\nThere are other and natural causes tending toward a diminution of\npopulation, but nothing contributes so greatly to this end as the fact\nthat no male or female Martian is ever voluntarily without a weapon of\ndestruction.\nAs we neared the plaza and my presence was discovered we were\nimmediately surrounded by hundreds of the creatures who seemed anxious\nto pluck me from my seat behind my guard. A word from the leader of\nthe party stilled their clamor, and we proceeded at a trot across the\nplaza to the entrance of as magnificent an edifice as mortal eye has\nrested upon.\nThe building was low, but covered an enormous area. It was constructed\nof gleaming white marble inlaid with gold and brilliant stones which\nsparkled and scintillated in the sunlight. The main entrance was some\nhundred feet in width and projected from the building proper to form a\nhuge canopy above the entrance hall. There was no stairway, but a\ngentle incline to the first floor of the building opened into an\nenormous chamber encircled by galleries.\nOn the floor of this chamber, which was dotted with highly carved\nwooden desks and chairs, were assembled about forty or fifty male\nMartians around the steps of a rostrum. On the platform proper\nsquatted an enormous warrior heavily loaded with metal ornaments,\ngay-colored feathers and beautifully wrought leather trappings\ningeniously set with precious stones. From his shoulders depended a\nshort cape of white fur lined with brilliant scarlet silk.\nWhat struck me as most remarkable about this assemblage and the hall in\nwhich they were congregated was the fact that the creatures were\nentirely out of proportion to the desks, chairs, and other furnishings;\nthese being of a size adapted to human beings such as I, whereas the\ngreat bulks of the Martians could scarcely have squeezed into the\nchairs, nor was there room beneath the desks for their long legs.\nEvidently, then, there were other denizens on Mars than the wild and\ngrotesque creatures into whose hands I had fallen, but the evidences of\nextreme antiquity which showed all around me indicated that these\nbuildings might have belonged to some long-extinct and forgotten race\nin the dim antiquity of Mars.\nOur party had halted at the entrance to the building, and at a sign\nfrom the leader I had been lowered to the ground. Again locking his\narm in mine, we had proceeded into the audience chamber. There were\nfew formalities observed in approaching the Martian chieftain. My\ncaptor merely strode up to the rostrum, the others making way for him\nas he advanced. The chieftain rose to his feet and uttered the name of\nmy escort who, in turn, halted and repeated the name of the ruler\nfollowed by his title.\nAt the time, this ceremony and the words they uttered meant nothing to\nme, but later I came to know that this was the customary greeting\nbetween green Martians. Had the men been strangers, and therefore\nunable to exchange names, they would have silently exchanged ornaments,\nhad their missions been peaceful--otherwise they would have exchanged\nshots, or have fought out their introduction with some other of their\nvarious weapons.\nMy captor, whose name was Tars Tarkas, was virtually the vice-chieftain\nof the community, and a man of great ability as a statesman and\nwarrior. He evidently explained briefly the incidents connected with\nhis expedition, including my capture, and when he had concluded the\nchieftain addressed me at some length.\nI replied in our good old English tongue merely to convince him that\nneither of us could understand the other; but I noticed that when I\nsmiled slightly on concluding, he did likewise. This fact, and the\nsimilar occurrence during my first talk with Tars Tarkas, convinced me\nthat we had at least something in common; the ability to smile,\ntherefore to laugh; denoting a sense of humor. But I was to learn that\nthe Martian smile is merely perfunctory, and that the Martian laugh is\na thing to cause strong men to blanch in horror.\nThe ideas of humor among the green men of Mars are widely at variance\nwith our conceptions of incitants to merriment. The death agonies of a\nfellow being are, to these strange creatures, provocative of the wildest\nhilarity, while their chief form of commonest amusement is to inflict\ndeath on their prisoners of war in various ingenious and horrible ways.\nThe assembled warriors and chieftains examined me closely, feeling my\nmuscles and the texture of my skin. The principal chieftain then\nevidently signified a desire to see me perform, and, motioning me to\nfollow, he started with Tars Tarkas for the open plaza.\nNow, I had made no attempt to walk, since my first signal failure,\nexcept while tightly grasping Tars Tarkas' arm, and so now I went\nskipping and flitting about among the desks and chairs like some\nmonstrous grasshopper. After bruising myself severely, much to the\namusement of the Martians, I again had recourse to creeping, but this\ndid not suit them and I was roughly jerked to my feet by a towering\nfellow who had laughed most heartily at my misfortunes.\nAs he banged me down upon my feet his face was bent close to mine and I\ndid the only thing a gentleman might do under the circumstances of\nbrutality, boorishness, and lack of consideration for a stranger's\nrights; I swung my fist squarely to his jaw and he went down like a\nfelled ox. As he sunk to the floor I wheeled around with my back\ntoward the nearest desk, expecting to be overwhelmed by the vengeance\nof his fellows, but determined to give them as good a battle as the\nunequal odds would permit before I gave up my life.\nMy fears were groundless, however, as the other Martians, at first\nstruck dumb with wonderment, finally broke into wild peals of laughter\nand applause. I did not recognize the applause as such, but later,\nwhen I had become acquainted with their customs, I learned that I had\nwon what they seldom accord, a manifestation of approbation.\nThe fellow whom I had struck lay where he had fallen, nor did any of\nhis mates approach him. Tars Tarkas advanced toward me, holding out\none of his arms, and we thus proceeded to the plaza without further\nmishap. I did not, of course, know the reason for which we had come to\nthe open, but I was not long in being enlightened. They first repeated\nthe word \"sak\" a number of times, and then Tars Tarkas made several\njumps, repeating the same word before each leap; then, turning to me,\nhe said, \"sak!\" I saw what they were after, and gathering myself\ntogether I \"sakked\" with such marvelous success that I cleared a good\nhundred and fifty feet; nor did I, this time, lose my equilibrium, but\nlanded squarely upon my feet without falling. I then returned by easy\njumps of twenty-five or thirty feet to the little group of warriors.\nMy exhibition had been witnessed by several hundred lesser Martians,\nand they immediately broke into demands for a repetition, which the\nchieftain then ordered me to make; but I was both hungry and thirsty,\nand determined on the spot that my only method of salvation was to\ndemand the consideration from these creatures which they evidently\nwould not voluntarily accord. I therefore ignored the repeated\ncommands to \"sak,\" and each time they were made I motioned to my mouth\nand rubbed my stomach.\nTars Tarkas and the chief exchanged a few words, and the former,\ncalling to a young female among the throng, gave her some instructions\nand motioned me to accompany her. I grasped her proffered arm and\ntogether we crossed the plaza toward a large building on the far side.\nMy fair companion was about eight feet tall, having just arrived at\nmaturity, but not yet to her full height. She was of a light\nolive-green color, with a smooth, glossy hide. Her name, as I\nafterward learned, was Sola, and she belonged to the retinue of Tars\nTarkas. She conducted me to a spacious chamber in one of the buildings\nfronting on the plaza, and which, from the litter of silks and furs\nupon the floor, I took to be the sleeping quarters of several of the\nnatives.\nThe room was well lighted by a number of large windows and was\nbeautifully decorated with mural paintings and mosaics, but upon all\nthere seemed to rest that indefinable touch of the finger of antiquity\nwhich convinced me that the architects and builders of these wondrous\ncreations had nothing in common with the crude half-brutes which now\noccupied them.\nSola motioned me to be seated upon a pile of silks near the center of\nthe room, and, turning, made a peculiar hissing sound, as though\nsignaling to someone in an adjoining room. In response to her call I\nobtained my first sight of a new Martian wonder. It waddled in on its\nten short legs, and squatted down before the girl like an obedient\npuppy. The thing was about the size of a Shetland pony, but its head\nbore a slight resemblance to that of a frog, except that the jaws were\nequipped with three rows of long, sharp tusks.\nCHAPTER V\nI ELUDE MY WATCH DOG\nSola stared into the brute's wicked-looking eyes, muttered a word or\ntwo of command, pointed to me, and left the chamber. I could not but\nwonder what this ferocious-looking monstrosity might do when left alone\nin such close proximity to such a relatively tender morsel of meat; but\nmy fears were groundless, as the beast, after surveying me intently for\na moment, crossed the room to the only exit which led to the street,\nand lay down full length across the threshold.\nThis was my first experience with a Martian watch dog, but it was\ndestined not to be my last, for this fellow guarded me carefully during\nthe time I remained a captive among these green men; twice saving my\nlife, and never voluntarily being away from me a moment.\nWhile Sola was away I took occasion to examine more minutely the room\nin which I found myself captive. The mural painting depicted scenes of\nrare and wonderful beauty; mountains, rivers, lake, ocean, meadow,\ntrees and flowers, winding roadways, sun-kissed gardens--scenes which\nmight have portrayed earthly views but for the different colorings of\nthe vegetation. The work had evidently been wrought by a master hand,\nso subtle the atmosphere, so perfect the technique; yet nowhere was\nthere a representation of a living animal, either human or brute, by\nwhich I could guess at the likeness of these other and perhaps extinct\ndenizens of Mars.\nWhile I was allowing my fancy to run riot in wild conjecture on the\npossible explanation of the strange anomalies which I had so far met\nwith on Mars, Sola returned bearing both food and drink. These she\nplaced on the floor beside me, and seating herself a short ways off\nregarded me intently. The food consisted of about a pound of some\nsolid substance of the consistency of cheese and almost tasteless,\nwhile the liquid was apparently milk from some animal. It was not\nunpleasant to the taste, though slightly acid, and I learned in a short\ntime to prize it very highly. It came, as I later discovered, not from\nan animal, as there is only one mammal on Mars and that one very rare\nindeed, but from a large plant which grows practically without water,\nbut seems to distill its plentiful supply of milk from the products of\nthe soil, the moisture of the air, and the rays of the sun. A single\nplant of this species will give eight or ten quarts of milk per day.\nAfter I had eaten I was greatly invigorated, but feeling the need of\nrest I stretched out upon the silks and was soon asleep. I must have\nslept several hours, as it was dark when I awoke, and I was very cold.\nI noticed that someone had thrown a fur over me, but it had become\npartially dislodged and in the darkness I could not see to replace it.\nSuddenly a hand reached out and pulled the fur over me, shortly\nafterwards adding another to my covering.\nI presumed that my watchful guardian was Sola, nor was I wrong. This\ngirl alone, among all the green Martians with whom I came in contact,\ndisclosed characteristics of sympathy, kindliness, and affection; her\nministrations to my bodily wants were unfailing, and her solicitous\ncare saved me from much suffering and many hardships.\nAs I was to learn, the Martian nights are extremely cold, and as there\nis practically no twilight or dawn, the changes in temperature are\nsudden and most uncomfortable, as are the transitions from brilliant\ndaylight to darkness. The nights are either brilliantly illumined or\nvery dark, for if neither of the two moons of Mars happen to be in the\nsky almost total darkness results, since the lack of atmosphere, or,\nrather, the very thin atmosphere, fails to diffuse the starlight to any\ngreat extent; on the other hand, if both of the moons are in the\nheavens at night the surface of the ground is brightly illuminated.\nBoth of Mars' moons are vastly nearer her than is our moon to Earth;\nthe nearer moon being but about five thousand miles distant, while the\nfurther is but little more than fourteen thousand miles away, against\nthe nearly one-quarter million miles which separate us from our moon.\nThe nearer moon of Mars makes a complete revolution around the planet\nin a little over seven and one-half hours, so that she may be seen\nhurtling through the sky like some huge meteor two or three times each\nnight, revealing all her phases during each transit of the heavens.\nThe further moon revolves about Mars in something over thirty and\none-quarter hours, and with her sister satellite makes a nocturnal\nMartian scene one of splendid and weird grandeur. And it is well that\nnature has so graciously and abundantly lighted the Martian night, for\nthe green men of Mars, being a nomadic race without high intellectual\ndevelopment, have but crude means for artificial lighting; depending\nprincipally upon torches, a kind of candle, and a peculiar oil lamp\nwhich generates a gas and burns without a wick.\nThis last device produces an intensely brilliant far-reaching white\nlight, but as the natural oil which it requires can only be obtained by\nmining in one of several widely separated and remote localities it is\nseldom used by these creatures whose only thought is for today, and\n\n",

They were\ntruly so wonderful that even now I am bewildered when I think of them.\nMy uncle was a German, having married my mother's sister, an\nEnglishwoman. Being very much attached to his fatherless nephew, he\ninvited me to study under him in his home in the fatherland. This home\nwas in a large town, and my uncle a professor of philosophy, chemistry,\ngeology, mineralogy, and many other ologies.\nOne day, after passing some hours in the laboratory--my uncle being\nabsent at the time--I suddenly felt the necessity of renovating the\ntissues--<i>i.e.</i>, I was hungry, and was about to rouse up our old French\ncook, when my uncle, Professor Von Hardwigg, suddenly opened the street\ndoor, and came rushing upstairs.\nNow Professor Hardwigg, my worthy uncle, is by no means a bad sort of\nman; he is, however, choleric and original. To bear with him means to\nobey; and scarcely had his heavy feet resounded within our joint\ndomicile than he shouted for me to attend upon him.\nSteel rods, loadstones, glass pipes, and bottles of various acids were\noftener before us than our meals. My uncle Hardwigg was once known to\nclassify six hundred different geological specimens by their weight,\nhardness, fusibility, sound, taste, and smell.\nHe corresponded with all the great, learned, and scientific men of the\nage. I was, therefore, in constant communication with, at all events the\nletters of, Sir Humphry Davy, Captain Franklin, and other great men.\nBut before I state the subject on which my uncle wished to confer with\nme, I must say a word about his personal appearance. Alas! my readers\nwill see a very different portrait of him at a future time, after he has\ngone through the fearful adventures yet to be related.\nMy uncle was fifty years old; tall, thin, and wiry. Large spectacles\nhid, to a certain extent, his vast, round, and goggle eyes, while his\nnose was irreverently compared to a thin file. So much indeed did it\nresemble that useful article, that a compass was said in his presence to\nhave made considerable N (Nasal) deviation.\nThe truth being told, however, the only article really attracted to my\nuncle's nose was tobacco.\nAnother peculiarity of his was, that he always stepped a yard at a time,\nclenched his fists as if he were going to hit you, and was, when in one\nof his peculiar humors, very far from a pleasant companion.\nIt is further necessary to observe that he lived in a very nice house,\nin that very nice street, the Konigstrasse at Hamburg. Though lying in\nthe centre of a town, it was perfectly rural in its aspect--half wood,\nhalf bricks, with old-fashioned gables--one of the few old houses spared\nby the great fire of 1842.\nWhen I say a nice house, I mean a handsome house--old, tottering, and\nnot exactly comfortable to English notions: a house a little off the\nperpendicular and inclined to fall into the neighboring canal; exactly\nthe house for a wandering artist to depict; all the more that you could\nscarcely see it for ivy and a magnificent old tree which grew over the\ndoor.\nTo my fancy he was making a great fuss about nothing, but it was not my\nprovince to say so. On the contrary, I professed considerable interest\nin the subject, and asked him what it was about.\n\"It is the Heims-Kringla of Snorre Tarleson,\" he said, \"the celebrated\nIcelandic author of the twelfth century--it is a true and correct\naccount of the Norwegian princes who reigned in Iceland.\"\nMy next question related to the language in which it was written. I\nhoped at all events it was translated into German. My uncle was\nindignant at the very thought, and declared he wouldn't give a penny for\na translation. His delight was to have found the original work in the\nIcelandic tongue, which he declared to be one of the most magnificent\nand yet simple idioms in the world--while at the same time its\ngrammatical combinations were the most varied known to students.\n\"About as easy as German?\" was my insidious remark.\nMy uncle shrugged his shoulders.\n\"The letters at all events,\" I said, \"are rather difficult of\ncomprehension.\"\n\"It is a Runic manuscript, the language of the original population of\nIceland, invented by Odin himself,\" cried my uncle, angry at my\nignorance.\nI was about to venture upon some misplaced joke on the subject, when a\nsmall scrap of parchment fell out of the leaves. Like a hungry man\nsnatching at a morsel of bread the Professor seized it. It was about\nfive inches by three and was scrawled over in the most extraordinary\nfashion.\nThe lines shown here are an exact facsimile of what was written on the\nvenerable piece of parchment--and have wonderful importance, as they\ninduced my uncle to undertake the most wonderful series of adventures\nwhich ever fell to the lot of human beings.\nMy uncle looked keenly at the document for some moments and then\ndeclared that it was Runic. The letters were similar to those in the\nbook, but then what did they mean? This was exactly what I wanted to\nknow.\nNow as I had a strong conviction that the Runic alphabet and dialect\nwere simply an invention to mystify poor human nature, I was delighted\nto find that my uncle knew as much about the matter as I did--which was\nnothing. At all events the tremulous motion of his fingers made me think\nso.\n\"And yet,\" he muttered to himself, \"it is old Icelandic, I am sure of\nit.\"\nAnd my uncle ought to have known, for he was a perfect polyglot\ndictionary in himself. He did not pretend, like a certain learned\npundit, to speak the two thousand languages and four thousand idioms\nmade use of in different parts of the globe, but he did know all the\nmore important ones.\nIt is a matter of great doubt to me now, to what violent measures my\nuncle's impetuosity might have led him, had not the clock struck two,\nand our old French cook called out to let us know that dinner was on the\ntable.\n\"Bother the dinner!\" cried my uncle.\nBut as I was hungry, I sallied forth to the dining room, where I took up\nmy usual quarters. Out of politeness I waited three minutes, but no sign\nof my uncle, the Professor. I was surprised. He was not usually so blind\nto the pleasure of a good dinner. It was the acme of German\nluxury--parsley soup, a ham omelette with sorrel trimmings, an oyster of\nveal stewed with prunes, delicious fruit, and sparkling Moselle. For the\nsake of poring over this musty old piece of parchment, my uncle forbore\nto share our meal. To satisfy my conscience, I ate for both.\nThe old cook and housekeeper was nearly out of her mind. After taking so\nmuch trouble, to find her master not appear at dinner was to her a sad\ndisappointment--which, as she occasionally watched the havoc I was\nmaking on the viands, became also alarm. If my uncle were to come to\ntable after all?\nSuddenly, just as I had consumed the last apple and drunk the last glass\nof wine, a terrible voice was heard at no great distance. It was my\nuncle roaring for me to come to him. I made very nearly one leap of\nit--so loud, so fierce was his tone.\nCHAPTER 2\nTHE MYSTERIOUS PARCHMENT\n[Illustration: Runic Glyphs]\n\"I Declare,\" cried my uncle, striking the table fiercely with his fist,\n\"I declare to you it is Runic--and contains some wonderful secret, which\nI must get at, at any price.\"\nI was about to reply when he stopped me.\n\"Sit down,\" he said, quite fiercely, \"and write to my dictation.\"\nI obeyed.\n\"I will substitute,\" he said, \"a letter of our alphabet for that of the\nRunic: we will then see what that will produce. Now, begin and make no\nmistakes.\"\nThe dictation commenced with the following incomprehensible result:\n mm.rnlls esruel seecJde\n sgtssmf unteief niedrke\n kt,samn atrateS Saodrrn\n emtnaeI nuaect rrilSa\n Atvaar .nscrc ieaabs\n ccdrmi eeutul frantu\n dt,iac oseibo KediiY\nScarcely giving me time to finish, my uncle snatched the document from\nmy hands and examined it with the most rapt and deep attention.\n\"I should like to know what it means,\" he said, after a long period.\nI certainly could not tell him, nor did he expect me to--his\nconversation being uniformly answered by himself.\n\"I declare it puts me in mind of a cryptograph,\" he cried, \"unless,\nindeed, the letters have been written without any real meaning; and yet\nwhy take so much trouble? Who knows but I may be on the verge of some\ngreat discovery?\"\nMy candid opinion was that it was all rubbish! But this opinion I kept\ncarefully to myself, as my uncle's choler was not pleasant to bear. All\nthis time he was comparing the book with the parchment.\n\"The manuscript volume and the smaller document are written in different\nhands,\" he said, \"the cryptograph is of much later date than the book;\nthere is an undoubted proof of the correctness of my surmise. [An\nirrefragable proof I took it to be.] The first letter is a double M,\nwhich was only added to the Icelandic language in the twelfth\ncentury--this makes the parchment two hundred years posterior to the\nvolume.\"\nThe circumstances appeared very probable and very logical, but it was\nall surmise to me.\n\"To me it appears probable that this sentence was written by some owner\nof the book. Now who was the owner, is the next important question.\nPerhaps by great good luck it may be written somewhere in the volume.\"\nWith these words Professor Hardwigg took off his spectacles, and, taking\na powerful magnifying glass, examined the book carefully.\nOn the fly leaf was what appeared to be a blot of ink, but on\nexamination proved to be a line of writing almost effaced by time. This\nwas what he sought; and, after some considerable time, he made out these\nletters:\n[Illustration: Runic Glyphs]\n\"Arne Saknussemm!\" he cried in a joyous and triumphant tone, \"that is\nnot only an Icelandic name, but of a learned professor of the sixteenth\ncentury, a celebrated alchemist.\"\nI bowed as a sign of respect.\n\"These alchemists,\" he continued, \"Avicenna, Bacon, Lully, Paracelsus,\nwere the true, the only learned men of the day. They made surprising\ndiscoveries. May not this Saknussemm, nephew mine, have hidden on this\nbit of parchment some astounding invention? I believe the cryptograph to\nhave a profound meaning--which I must make out.\"\nMy uncle walked about the room in a state of excitement almost\nimpossible to describe.\n\"It may be so, sir,\" I timidly observed, \"but why conceal it from\nposterity, if it be a useful, a worthy discovery?\"\n\"Why--how should I know? Did not Galileo make a secret of his\ndiscoveries in connection with Saturn? But we shall see. Until I\ndiscover the meaning of this sentence I will neither eat nor sleep.\"\n\"My dear uncle--\" I began.\n\"Nor you neither,\" he added.\nIt was lucky I had taken double allowance that day.\n\"In the first place,\" he continued, \"there must be a clue to the\nmeaning. If we could find that, the rest would be easy enough.\"\nI began seriously to reflect. The prospect of going without food and\nsleep was not a promising one, so I determined to do my best to solve\nthe mystery. My uncle, meanwhile, went on with his soliloquy.\n\"The way to discover it is easy enough. In this document there are one\nhundred and thirty-two letters, giving seventy-nine consonants to\nfifty-three vowels. This is about the proportion found in most southern\nlanguages, the idioms of the north being much more rich in consonants.\nWe may confidently predict, therefore, that we have to deal with a\nsouthern dialect.\"\nNothing could be more logical.\n\"Now,\" said Professor Hardwigg, \"to trace the particular language.\"\n\"As Shakespeare says, 'that is the question,\"' was my rather satirical\nreply.\n\"This man Saknussemm,\" he continued, \"was a very learned man: now as he\ndid not write in the language of his birthplace, he probably, like most\nlearned men of the sixteenth century, wrote in Latin. If, however, I\nprove wrong in this guess, we must try Spanish, French, Italian, Greek,\nand even Hebrew. My own opinion, though, is decidedly in favor of\nLatin.\"\nThis proposition startled me. Latin was my favorite study, and it seemed\nsacrilege to believe this gibberish to belong to the country of Virgil.\n\"Barbarous Latin, in all probability,\" continued my uncle, \"but still\nLatin.\"\n\"Very probably,\" I replied, not to contradict him.\n\"Let us see into the matter,\" continued my uncle; \"here you see we have\na series of one hundred and thirty-two letters, apparently thrown\npell-mell upon paper, without method or organization. There are words\nwhich are composed wholly of consonants, such as <i>mm.rnlls</i>, others\nwhich are nearly all vowels, the fifth, for instance, which is unteief,\nand one of the last oseibo. This appears an extraordinary combination.\nProbably we shall find that the phrase is arranged according to some\nmathematical plan. No doubt a certain sentence has been written out and\nthen jumbled up--some plan to which some figure is the clue. Now, Harry,\nto show your English wit--what is that figure?\"\nI could give him no hint. My thoughts were indeed far away. While he was\nspeaking I had caught sight of the portrait of my cousin Gretchen, and\nwas wondering when she would return.\nWe were affianced, and loved one another very sincerely. But my uncle,\nwho never thought even of such sublunary matters, knew nothing of this.\nWithout noticing my abstraction, the Professor began reading the\npuzzling cryptograph all sorts of ways, according to some theory of his\nown. Presently, rousing my wandering attention, he dictated one precious\nattempt to me.\nI mildly handed it over to him. It read as follows:\n  <i>mmessunkaSenrA.icefdoK.segnittamurtn\n  ecertserrette,rotaivsadua,ednecsedsadne\n  lacartniiilrJsiratracSarbmutabiledmek\n  meretarcsilucoYsleffenSnI.</i>\nI could scarcely keep from laughing, while my uncle, on the contrary,\ngot in a towering passion, struck the table with his fist, darted out of\nthe room, out of the house, and then taking to his heels was presently\nlost to sight.\nCHAPTER 3\nAN ASTOUNDING DISCOVERY\n\"What is the matter?\" cried the cook, entering the room; \"when will\nmaster have his dinner?\"\n\"Never.\"\n\"And, his supper?\"\n\"I don't know. He says he will eat no more, neither shall I. My uncle\nhas determined to fast and make me fast until he makes out this\nabominable inscription,\" I replied.\n\"You will be starved to death,\" she said.\nI was very much of the same opinion, but not liking to say so, sent her\naway, and began some of my usual work of classification. But try as I\nmight, nothing could keep me from thinking alternately of the stupid\nmanuscript and of the pretty Gretchen.\nSeveral times I thought of going out, but my uncle would have been angry\nat my absence. At the end of an hour, my allotted task was done. How to\npass the time? I began by lighting my pipe. Like all other students, I\ndelighted in tobacco; and, seating myself in the great armchair, I began\nto think.\nWhere was my uncle? I could easily imagine him tearing along some\nsolitary road, gesticulating, talking to himself, cutting the air with\nhis cane, and still thinking of the absurd bit of hieroglyphics. Would\nhe hit upon some clue? Would he come home in better humor? While these\nthoughts were passing through my brain, I mechanically took up the\nexecrable puzzle and tried every imaginable way of grouping the letters.\nI put them together by twos, by threes, fours, and fives--in vain.\nNothing intelligible came out, except that the fourteenth, fifteenth,\nand sixteenth made <i>ice</i> in English; the eighty-fourth, eighty-fifth,\nand eighty-sixth, the word <i>sir</i>; then at last I seemed to find the\nLatin words <i>rota, mutabile, ira, nec, atra</i>.\n\"Ha! there seems to be some truth in my uncle's notion,\" thought I.\nThen again I seemed to find the word <i>luco</i>, which means sacred wood.\nThen in the third line I appeared to make out <i>labiled</i>, a perfect\nHebrew word, and at the last the syllables mere, are, mer, which were\nFrench.\nIt was enough to drive one mad. Four different idioms in this absurd\nphrase. What connection could there be between ice, sir, anger, cruel,\nsacred wood, changing, mother, are, and sea? The first and the last\nmight, in a sentence connected with Iceland, mean sea of ice. But what\nof the rest of this monstrous cryptograph?\nI was, in fact, fighting against an insurmountable difficulty; my brain\nwas almost on fire; my eyes were strained with staring at the parchment;\nthe whole absurd collection of letters appeared to dance before my\nvision in a number of black little groups. My mind was possessed with\ntemporary hallucination--I was stifling. I wanted air. Mechanically I\nfanned myself with the document, of which now I saw the back and then\nthe front.\nImagine my surprise when glancing at the back of the wearisome puzzle,\nthe ink having gone through, I clearly made out Latin words, and among\nothers craterem and terrestre.\n\n\"Backwards!\" cried my uncle, in wild amazement. \"Oh most cunning\nSaknussemm; and I to be such a blockhead!\"\nHe snatched up the document, gazed at it with haggard eye, and read it\nout as I had done.\nIt read as follows:\n  <i>In Sneffels Yoculis craterem kem delibat\n  umbra Scartaris Julii intra calendas descende,\n  audas viator, et terrestre centrum attinges.\n  Kod feci. Arne Saknussemm</i>\nWhich dog Latin being translated, reads as follows:\n Descend into the crater of Yocul of Sneffels, which the shade of\n Scartaris caresses, before the kalends of July, audacious traveler,\n and you will reach the centre of the earth. I did it.\n  ARNE SAKNUSSEMM\n\n\nAfter this what more could I say? Yes,--I thought of another objection.\n\"But what is all this about Scartaris and the kalends of July--?\"\nMy uncle reflected deeply. Presently he gave forth the result of his\nreflections in a sententious tone. \"What appears obscure to you, to me\nis light. This very phrase shows how particular Saknussemm is in his\ndirections. The Sneffels mountain has many craters. He is careful\ntherefore to point the exact one which is the highway into the Interior\nof the Earth. He lets us know, for this purpose, that about the end of\nthe month of June, the shadow of Mount Scartaris falls upon the one\ncrater. There can be no doubt about the matter.\"\nMy uncle had an answer for everything.\n\"I accept all your explanations\" I said, \"and Saknussemm is right. He\nfound out the entrance to the bowels of the earth, he has indicated\ncorrectly, but that he or anyone else ever followed up the discovery is\nmadness to suppose.\"\n\n\"And now that we have come to a thorough understanding, not a word to\nany living soul. Our success depends on secrecy and dispatch.\"\nThus ended our memorable conference, which roused a perfect fever in me.\nLeaving my uncle, I went forth like one possessed. Reaching the banks of\nthe Elbe, I began to think. Was all I had heard really and truly\npossible? Was my uncle in his sober senses, and could the interior of\nthe earth be reached? Was I the victim of a madman, or was he a\ndiscoverer of rare courage and grandeur of conception?\nTo a certain extent I was anxious to be off. I was afraid my enthusiasm\nwould cool. I determined to pack up at once. At the end of an hour,\nhowever, on my way home, I found that my feelings had very much changed.\n\"I'm all abroad,\" I cried; \"'tis a nightmare--I must have dreamed it.\"\nAt this moment I came face to face with Gretchen, whom I warmly\nembraced.\n\"So you have come to meet me,\" she said; \"how good of you. But what is\nthe matter?\"\nWell, it was no use mincing the matter, I told her all. She listened\nwith awe, and for some minutes she could not speak.\n\"Well?\" I at last said, rather anxiously.\n\"What a magnificent journey. If I were only a man! A journey worthy of\nthe nephew of Professor Hardwigg. I should look upon it as an honor to\naccompany him.\"\n\"My dear Gretchen, I thought you would be the first to cry out against\nthis mad enterprise.\"\n\"No; on the contrary, I glory in it. It is magnificent, splendid--an\nidea worthy of my father. Henry Lawson, I envy you.\"\nThis was, as it were, conclusive. The final blow of all.\nWhen we entered the house we found my uncle surrounded by workmen and\nporters, who were packing up. He was pulling and hauling at a bell.\n\"Where have you been wasting your time? Your portmanteau is not\npacked--my papers are not in order--the precious tailor has not brought\nmy clothes, nor my gaiters--the key of my carpet bag is gone!\"\nI looked at him stupefied. And still he tugged away at the bell.\n\"We are really off, then?\" I said.\n\"Yes--of course, and yet you go out for a stroll, unfortunate boy!\"\n\"And when do we go?\"\n\"The day after tomorrow, at daybreak.\"\nI heard no more; but darted off to my little bedchamber and locked\nmyself in. There was no doubt about it now. My uncle had been hard at\nwork all the afternoon. The garden was full of ropes, rope ladders,\ntorches, gourds, iron clamps, crowbars, alpenstocks, and\npickaxes--enough to load ten men.\nI passed a terrible night. I was called early the next day to learn that\nthe resolution of my uncle was unchanged and irrevocable. I also found\nmy cousin and affianced wife as warm on the subject as was her father.\nNext day, at five o'clock in the morning, the post chaise was at the\ndoor. Gretchen and the old cook received the keys of the house; and,\nscarcely pausing to wish anyone good-by, we started on our adventurous\njourney into the centre of the earth.\nCHAPTER 5\nFirst Lessons in Climbing\nAt Altona, a suburb of Hamburg, is the Chief Station of the Kiel\nrailway, which was to take us to the shores of the Belt. In twenty\nminutes from the moment of our departure we were in Holstein, and our\ncarriage entered the station. Our heavy luggage was taken out, weighed,\nlabeled, and placed in a huge van. We then took our tickets, and exactly\nat seven o'clock were seated opposite each other in a firstclass railway\ncarriage.\nMy uncle said nothing. He was too busy examining his papers, among which\nof course was the famous parchment, and some letters of introduction\nfrom the Danish consul which were to pave the way to an introduction to\nthe Governor of Iceland. My only amusement was looking out of the\nwindow. But as we passed through a flat though fertile country, this\noccupation was slightly monotonous. In three hours we reached Kiel, and\nour baggage was at once transferred to the steamer.\nWe had now a day before us, a delay of about ten hours. Which fact put\nmy uncle in a towering passion. We had nothing to do but to walk about\nthe pretty town and bay. At length, however, we went on board, and at\nhalf past ten were steaming down the Great Belt. It was a dark night,\nwith a strong breeze and a rough sea, nothing being visible but the\noccasional fires on shore, with here and there a lighthouse. At seven in\nthe morning we left Korsor, a little town on the western side of\nSeeland.\nHere we took another railway, which in three hours brought us to the\ncapital, Copenhagen, where, scarcely taking time for refreshment, my\nuncle hurried out to present one of his letters of introduction. It was\nto the director of the Museum of Antiquities, who, having been informed\nthat we were tourists bound for Iceland, did all he could to assist us.\nOne wretched hope sustained me now. Perhaps no vessel was bound for such\ndistant parts.\nSneffels volcano\nProfessor Hardwigg was in haste to leave his prison, or rather as he\ncalled it, his hospital; but before he attempted to do so, he caught\nhold of my hand, led me to the quarterdeck of the schooner, took my arm\nwith his left hand, and pointed inland with his right, over the northern\npart of the bay, to where rose a high two-peaked mountain--a double cone\ncovered with eternal snow.\n\"Behold he whispered in an awe-stricken voice, behold--Mount Sneffels!\"\nThen without further remark, he put his finger to his lips, frowned\ndarkly, and descended into the small boat which awaited us. I followed,\nand in a few minutes we stood upon the soil of mysterious Iceland!\nScarcely were we fairly on shore when there appeared before us a man of\nexcellent appearance, wearing the costume of a military officer. He was,\nhowever, but a civil servant, a magistrate, the governor of the\nisland--Baron Trampe. The Professor knew whom he had to deal with. He\ntherefore handed him the letters from Copenhagen, and a brief\nconversation in Danish followed, to which I of course was a stranger,\nand for a very good reason, for I did not know the language in which\nthey conversed. I afterwards heard, however, that Baron Trampe placed\nhimself entirely at the beck and call of Professor Hardwigg.\nMy uncle was most graciously received by M. Finsen, the mayor, who as\nfar as costume went, was quite as military as the governor, but also\nfrom character and occupation quite as pacific. As for his coadjutor, M.\nPictursson, he was absent on an episcopal visit to the northern portion\nof the diocese. We were therefore compelled to defer the pleasure of\nbeing presented to him. His absence was, however, more than compensated\nby the presence of M. Fridriksson, professor of natural science in the\ncollege of Reykjavik, a man of invaluable ability. This modest scholar\nspoke no languages save Icelandic and Latin. When, therefore, he\naddressed himself to me in the language of Horace, we at once came to\nunderstand one another. He was, in fact, the only person that I did\nthoroughly understand during the whole period of my residence in this\nbenighted island.\nOut of three rooms of which his house was composed, two were placed at\nour service, and in a few hours we were installed with all our baggage,\nthe amount of which rather astonished the simple inhabitants of\nReykjavik.\n\"Now, Harry,\" said my uncle, rubbing his hands, \"an goes well, the worse\ndifficulty is now over.\"\n\"How the worse difficulty over?\" I cried in fresh amazement.\n\"Doubtless. Here we are in Iceland. Nothing more remains but to descend\ninto the bowels of the earth.\"\n\"Well, sir, to a certain extent you are right. We have only to go\ndown--but, as far as I am concerned, that is not the question. I want to\nknow how we are to get up again.\"\n\"That is the least part of the business, and does not in any way trouble\nme. In the meantime, there is not an hour to lose. I am about to visit\nthe public library. Very likely I may find there some manuscripts from\nthe hand of Saknussemm. I shall be glad to consult them.\"\n\"In the meanwhile,\" I replied, \"I will take a walk through the town.\nWill you not likewise do so?\"\n\"I feel no interest in the subject,\" said my uncle. \"What for me is\ncurious in this island, is not what is above the surface, but what is\nbelow.\"\nI bowed by way of reply, put on my hat and furred cloak, and went out.\nIt was not an easy matter to lose oneself in the two streets of\nReykjavik; I had therefore no need to ask my way. The town lies on a\nflat and marshy plain, between two hills. A vast field of lava skirts it\non one side, falling away in terraces towards the sea. On the other hand\nis the large bay of Faxa, bordered on the north by the enormous glacier\nof Sneffels, and in which bay the <i>Valkyrie</i> was then the only vessel at\nanchor. Generally there were one or two English or French gunboats, to\nwatch and protect the fisheries in the offing. They were now, however,\nabsent on duty.\nThe longest of the streets of Reykjavik runs parallel to the shore. In\nthis street the merchants and traders live in wooden huts made with\nbeams of wood, painted red--mere log huts, such as you find in the wilds\nof America. The other street, situated more to the west, runs toward a\nlittle lake between the residences of the bishop and the other\npersonages not engaged in commerce.\nI had soon seen all I wanted of these weary and dismal thoroughfares.\nHere and there was a strip of discolored turf, like an old worn-out bit\nof woolen carpet; and now and then a bit of kitchen garden, in which\ngrew potatoes, cabbage, and lettuce, almost diminutive enough to suggest\nthe idea of Lilliput.\nIn the centre of the new commercial street, I found the public cemetery,\nenclosed by an earthen wall. Though not very large, it appeared not\nlikely to be filled for centuries. From hence I went to the house of the\nGovernor--a mere hut in comparison with the Mansion House of\nHamburg--but a palace alongside the other Icelandic houses. Between the\nlittle lake and the town was the church, built in simple Protestant\nstyle, and composed of calcined stones, thrown up by volcanic action. I\nhave not the slightest doubt that in high winds its red tiles were blown\nout, to the great annoyance of the pastor and congregation. Upon an\neminence close at hand was the national school, in which were taught\nHebrew, English, French, and Danish.\nIn three hours my tour was complete. The general impression upon my mind\nwas sadness. No trees, no vegetation, so to speak--on all sides volcanic\npeaks--the huts of turf and earth--more like roofs than houses. Thanks\nto the heat of these residences, grass grows on the roof, which grass is\ncarefully cut for hay. I saw but few inhabitants during my excursion,\nbut I met a crowd on the beach, drying, salting and loading codfish, the\nprincipal article of exportation. The men appeared robust but heavy;\nfair-haired like Germans, but of pensive mien--exiles of a higher scale\nin the ladder of humanity than the Eskimos, but, I thought, much more\nunhappy, since with superior perceptions they are compelled to live\nwithin the limits of the Polar Circle.\n\nCHAPTER 7\nConversation and Discovery\nWhen I returned, dinner was ready. This meal was devoured by my worthy\nrelative with avidity and voracity. His shipboard diet had turned his\ninterior into a perfect gulf. The repast, which was more Danish than\nIcelandic, was in itself nothing, but the excessive hospitality of our\nhost made us enjoy it doubly.\nThe conversation turned upon scientific matters, and M. Fridriksson\nasked my uncle what he thought of the public library.\n\"Library, sir?\" cried my uncle; \"it appears to me a collection of\nuseless odd volumes, and a beggarly amount of empty shelves.\"\n\"What!\" cried M. Fridriksson; \"why, we have eight thousand volumes of\nmost rare and valuable works--some in the Scandinavian language, besides\nall the new publications from Copenhagen.\"\n\"Then when foreigners visit you, there is nothing for them to see?\"\n\"Well, sir, foreigners have their own libraries, and our first\nconsideration is, that our humbler classes should be highly educated.\nFortunately, the love of study is innate in the Icelandic people. In\n1816 we founded a Literary Society and Mechanics' Institute; many\nforeign scholars of eminence are honorary members; we publish books\ndestined to educate our people, and these books have rendered valuable\nservices to our country. Allow me to have the honor, Professor Hardwigg,\nto enroll you as an honorary member?\"\nMy uncle, who already belonged to nearly every literary and scientific\ninstitution in Europe, immediately yielded to the amiable wishes of good\nM. Fridriksson.\n\"And now,\" he said, after many expressions of gratitude and good will,\n\"if you will tell me what books you expected to find, perhaps I may be\nof some assistance to you.\"\nI watched my uncle keenly. For a minute or two he hesitated, as if\nunwilling to speak; to speak openly was, perhaps, to unveil his\nprojects. Nevertheless, after some reflection, he made up his mind.\n\"Well, M. Fridriksson,\" he said in an easy, unconcerned kind of way, \"I\nwas desirous of ascertaining, if among other valuable works, you had any\nof the learned Arne Saknussemm.\"\n\"Arne Saknussemm!\" cried the Professor of Reykjavik; \"you speak of one\nof the most distinguished scholars of the sixteenth century, of the\ngreat naturalist, the great alchemist, the great traveler.\"\nThis portion of the conversation took place in Latin, and I therefore\nunderstood all that had been said. I could scarcely keep my countenance\nwhen I found my uncle so cunningly concealing his delight and\nsatisfaction. I must confess that his artful grimaces, put on to conceal\nhis happiness, made him look like a new Mephistopheles.\n\"Yes, yes,\" he continued, \"your proposition delights me. I will endeavor\nto climb to the summit of Sneffels, and, if possible, will descend into\nits crater.\"\n\"I very much regret,\" continued M. Fridriksson, \"that my occupation will\nentirely preclude the possibility of my accompanying you. It would have\nbeen both pleasurable and profitable if I could have spared the time.\"\n\"No, no, a thousand times no,\" cried my uncle. \"I do not wish to disturb\nthe serenity of any man. I thank you, however, with all my heart. The\npresence of one so learned as yourself, would no doubt have been most\nuseful, but the duties of your office and profession before everything.\"\nIn the innocence of his simple heart, our host did not perceive the\nirony of these remarks.\n\"I entirely approve your project,\" continued the Icelander after some\nfurther remarks. \"It is a good idea to begin by examining this volcano.\nYou will make a harvest of curious observations. In the first place, how\ndo you propose to get to Sneffels?\"\n\"By sea. I shall cross the bay. Of course that is the most rapid route.\"\n\"Of course. But still it cannot be done.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"We have not an available boat in all Reykjavik,\" replied the other.\n\"What is to be done?\"\n\"You must go by land along the coast. It is longer, but much more\ninteresting.\"\n\"Then I must have a guide.\"\n\"Of course; and I have your very man.\"\n\"Somebody on whom I can depend.\"\n\"Yes, an inhabitant of the peninsula on which Sneffels is situated. He\nis a very shrewd and worthy man, with whom you will be pleased. He\nspeaks Danish like a Dane.\"\n\"When can I see him--today?\"\n\"No, tomorrow; he will not be here before.\"\n\"Tomorrow be it,\" replied my uncle, with a deep sigh.\nThe conversation ended by compliments on both sides. During the dinner\nmy uncle had learned much as to the history of Arne Saknussemm, the\nreasons for his mysterious and hieroglyphical document. He also became\naware that his host would not accompany him on his adventurous\nexpedition, and that next day we should have a guide.\nCHAPTER 8\nTHE EIDER-DOWN HUNTER--OFF AT LAST\nThat evening I took a brief walk on the shore near Reykjavik, after\nwhich I returned to an early sleep on my bed of coarse planks, where I\nslept the sleep of the just. When I awoke I heard my uncle speaking\nloudly in the next room. I rose hastily and joined him. He was talking\nin Danish with a man of tall stature, and of perfectly Herculean build.\nThis man appeared to be possessed of very great strength. His eyes,\nwhich started rather prominently from a very large head, the face\nbelonging to which was simple and naive, appeared very quick and\nintelligent. Very long hair, which even in England would have been\naccounted exceedingly red, fell over his athletic shoulders. This native\nof Iceland was active and supple in appearance, though he scarcely moved\nhis arms, being in fact one of those men who despise the habit of\ngesticulation common to southern people.\nEverything in this man's manner revealed a calm and phlegmatic\ntemperament. There was nothing indolent about him, but his appearance\nspoke of tranquillity. He was one of those who never seemed to expect\nanything from anybody, who liked to work when he thought proper, and\nwhose philosophy nothing could astonish or trouble.\nI began to comprehend his character, simply from the way in which he\nlistened to the wild and impassioned verbiage of my worthy uncle. While\nthe excellent Professor spoke sentence after sentence, he stood with\nfolded arms, utterly still, motionless to all my uncle's gesticulations.\nWhen he wanted to say No he moved his head from left to right; when he\nacquiesced he nodded, so slightly that you could scarcely see the\nundulation of his head. This economy of motion was carried to the length\nof avarice.\nJudging from his appearance I should have been a long time before I had\nsuspected him to be what he was, a mighty hunter. Certainly his manner\nwas not likely to frighten the game. How, then, did he contrive to get\nat his prey?\nMy surprise was slightly modified when I knew that this tranquil and\nsolemn personage was only a hunter of the eider duck, the down of which\nis, after all, the greatest source of the Icelanders' wealth.\nIn the early days of summer, the female of the eider, a pretty sort of\nduck, builds its nest amid the rocks of the fjords--the name given to\nall narrow gulfs in Scandinavian countries--with which every part of the\nisland is indented. No sooner has the eider duck made her nest than she\nlines the inside of it with the softest down from her breast. Then comes\nthe hunter or trader, taking away the nest, the poor bereaved female\nbegins her task over again, and this continues as long as any eider down\nis to be found.\nWhen she can find no more the male bird sets to work to see what he can\ndo. As, however, his down is not so soft, and has therefore no\ncommercial value, the hunter does not take the trouble to rob him of his\nnest lining. The nest is accordingly finished, the eggs are laid, the\nlittle ones are born, and next year the harvest of eider down is again\ncollected.\nNow, as the eider duck never selects steep rocks or aspects to build its\nnest, but rather sloping and low cliffs near to the sea, the Icelandic\nhunter can carry on his trade operations without much difficulty. He is\nlike a farmer who has neither to plow, to sow, nor to harrow, only to\ncollect his harvest.\nThis grave, sententious, silent person, as phlegmatic as an Englishman\non the French stage, was named Hans Bjelke. He had called upon us in\nconsequence of the recommendation of M. Fridriksson. He was, in fact,\nour future guide. It struck me that had I sought the world over, I could\nnot have found a greater contradiction to my impulsive uncle.\nThey, however, readily understood one another. Neither of them had any\nthought about money; one was ready to take all that was offered him, the\nother ready to offer anything that was asked. It may readily be\nconceived, then, that an understanding was soon come to between them.\nNow, the understanding was, that he was to take us to the village of\nStapi, situated on the southern slope of the peninsula of Sneffels, at\nthe very foot of the volcano. Hans, the guide, told us the distance was\nabout twenty-two miles, a journey which my uncle supposed would take\nabout two days.\nBut when my uncle came to understand that they were Danish miles, of\neight thousand yards each, he was obliged to be more moderate in his\nideas, and, considering the horrible roads we had to follow, to allow\neight or ten days for the journey.\nFour horses were prepared for us, two to carry the baggage, and two to\nbear the important weight of myself and uncle. Hans declared that\nnothing ever would make him climb on the back of any animal. He knew\nevery inch of that part of the coast, and promised to take us the very\nshortest way.\nHis engagement with my uncle was by no means to cease with our arrival\nat Stapi; he was further to remain in his service during the whole time\nrequired for the completion of his scientific investigations, at the\nfixed salary of three rix-dollars a week, being exactly fourteen\nshillings and twopence, minus one farthing, English currency. One\nstipulation, however, was made by the guide--the money was to be paid to\nhim every Saturday night, failing which, his engagement was at an end.\nThe day of our departure was fixed. My uncle wished to hand the\neider-down hunter an advance, but he refused in one emphatic word--\n\"Efter.\"\nWhich being translated from Icelandic into plain English means--\"After.\"\nThe treaty concluded, our worthy guide retired without another word.\n\"A splendid fellow,\" said my uncle; \"only he little suspects the\nmarvelous part he is about to play in the history of the world.\"\n\"You mean, then,\" I cried in amazement, \"that he should accompany us?\"\n\"To the interior of the earth, yes,\" replied my uncle. \"Why not?\"\nThere were yet forty-eight hours to elapse before we made our final\nstart. To my great regret, our whole time was taken up in making\npreparations for our journey. All our industry and ability were devoted\nto packing every object in the most advantageous manner--the instruments\non one side, the arms on the other, the tools here and the provisions\nthere. There were, in fact, four distinct groups.\nThe instruments were of course of the best manufacture:\n1. A centigrade thermometer of Eigel, counting up to 150 degrees, which\nto me did not appear half enough--or too much. Too hot by half, if the\ndegree of heat was to ascend so high--in which case we should certainly\nbe cooked--not enough, if we wanted to ascertain the exact temperature\nof springs or metal in a state of fusion.\n2. A manometer worked by compressed air, an instrument used to ascertain\nthe upper atmospheric pressure on the level of the ocean. Perhaps a\ncommon barometer would not have done as well, the atmospheric pressure\nbeing likely to increase in proportion as we descended below the surface\nof the earth.\n3. A first-class chronometer made by Boissonnas, of Geneva, set at the\nmeridian of Hamburg, from which Germans calculate, as the English do\nfrom Greenwich, and the French from Paris.\n4. Two compasses, one for horizontal guidance, the other to ascertain\nthe dip.\n5. A night glass.\n6. Two Ruhmkorff coils, which, by means of a current of electricity,\nwould ensure us a very excellent, easily carried, and certain means of\nobtaining light.\n7. A voltaic battery on the newest principle.[1]\n[1] Thermometer (<i>thermos</i>, and <i>metron</i>, measure); an instrument for\nmeasuring the temperature of the air.--Manometer (<i>manos</i>,and <i>metron</i>,\nmeasure); an instrument to show the density or rarity of\ngases.--Chronometer (<i>chronos</i>. time, and <i>metros</i>, measure) a time\nmeasurer, or superior watch--Ruhmkorff's coil, an instrument for\nproducing currents of induced electricity of great intensity. It\nconsists of a coil of copper wire, insulated by being covered with silk,\nsurrounded by another coil of fine wire, also insulated, in which a\nmomentary current is induced when a current is passed through the inner\ncoil from a voltaic battery. When the apparatus is in action, the gas\nbecomes luminous, and produces a white and continued light. The battery\nand wire are carried in a leather bag, which the traveler fastens by a\nstrap to his shoulders. The lantern is in front, and enables the\nbenighted wanderer to see in the most profound obscurity. He may venture\nwithout fear of explosion into the midst of the most inflammable gases,\nand the lantern will burn beneath the deepest waters. H. D. Ruhmkorff,\nan able and learned chemist, discovered the induction coil. In 1864 he\nwon the quinquennial French prize of £2,000 for this ingenious\napplication of electricity--A voltaic battery, so called from Volta, its\ndesigner, is an apparatus consisting of a series of metal plates\narranged in pairs and subjected to the action of saline solutions for\nproducing currents of electricity.\nOur arms consisted of two rifles, with two revolving six-shooters. Why\nthese arms were provided it was impossible for me to say. I had every\nreason to believe that we had neither wild beasts nor savage natives to\nfear. My uncle, on the other hand, was quite as devoted to his arsenal\nas to his collection of instruments, and above all was very careful with\nhis provision of fulminating or gun cotton, warranted to keep in any\nclimate, and of which the expansive force was known to be greater than\nthat of ordinary gunpowder.\nOur tools consisted of two pickaxes, two crowbars, a silken ladder,\nthree iron-shod Alpine poles, a hatchet, a hammer, a dozen wedges, some\npointed pieces of iron, and a quantity of strong rope. You may conceive\nthat the whole made a tolerable parcel, especially when I mention that\nthe ladder itself was three hundred feet long!\nThen there came the important question of provisions. The hamper was not\nvery large but tolerably satisfactory, for I knew that in concentrated\nessence of meat and biscuit there was enough to last six months. The\nonly liquid provided by my uncle was Schiedam. Of water, not a drop. We\nhad, however, an ample supply of gourds, and my uncle counted on finding\nwater, and enough to fill them, as soon as we commenced our downward\njourney. My remarks as to the temperature, the quality, and even as to\nthe possibility of none being found, remained wholly without effect.\nTo make up the exact list of our traveling gear--for the guidance of\nfuture travelers--add, that we carried a medicine and surgical chest\nwith all apparatus necessary for wounds, fractures and blows; lint,\nscissors, lancets--in fact, a perfect collection of horrible looking\ninstruments; a number of vials containing ammonia, alcohol, ether,\nGoulard water, aromatic vinegar, in fact, every possible and impossible\ndrug--finally, all the materials for working the Ruhmkorff coil!\nMy uncle had also been careful to lay in a goodly supply of tobacco,\nseveral flasks of very fine gunpowder, boxes of tinder, besides a large\nbelt crammed full of notes and gold. Good boots rendered watertight were\nto be found to the number of six in the tool box.\n\"My boy, with such clothing, with such boots, and such general\nequipment,\" said my uncle, in a state of rapturous delight, \"we may hope\nto travel far.\"\nIt took a whole day to put all these matters in order. In the evening we\ndined with Baron Trampe, in company with the Mayor of Reykjavik, and\nDoctor Hyaltalin, the great medical man of Iceland. M. Fridriksson was\nnot present, and I was afterwards sorry to hear that he and the governor\ndid not agree on some matters connected with the administration of the\nisland. Unfortunately, the consequence was, that I did not understand a\nword that was said at dinner--a kind of semiofficial reception. One\nthing I can say, my uncle never left off speaking.\nThe next day our labor came to an end. Our worthy host delighted my\nuncle, Professor Hardwigg, by giving him a good map of Iceland, a most\nimportant and precious document for a mineralogist.\nOur last evening was spent in a long conversation with M. Fridriksson,\nwhom I liked very much--the more that I never expected to see him or\nanyone else again. After this agreeable way of spending an hour or so, I\ntried to sleep. In vain; with the exception of a few dozes, my night was\nmiserable.\nAt five o'clock in the morning I was awakened from the only real half\nhour's sleep of the night by the loud neighing of horses under my\nwindow. I hastily dressed myself and went down into the street. Hans was\nengaged in putting the finishing stroke to our baggage, which he did in\na silent, quiet way that won my admiration, and yet he did it admirably\nwell. My uncle wasted a great deal of breath in giving him directions,\nbut worthy Hans took not the slightest notice of his words.\nAt six o'clock all our preparations were completed, and M. Fridriksson\nshook hands heartily with us. My uncle thanked him warmly, in the\nIcelandic language, for his kind hospitality, speaking truly from the\nheart.\nAs for myself I put together a few of my best Latin phrases and paid him\nthe highest compliments I could. This fraternal and friendly duty\nperformed, we sallied forth and mounted our horses.\nAs soon as we were quite ready, M. Fridriksson advanced, and by way of\nfarewell, called after me in the words of Virgil--words which appeared\nto have been made for us, travelers starting for an uncertain\ndestination:\n\"Et quacunque viam dederit fortuna sequamur.\"\n(\"And whichsoever way thou goest, may fortune follow!\")\nCHAPTER 9\nOUR START--WE MEET WITH ADVENTURES BY THE WAY\nThe weather was overcast but settled, when we commenced our adventurous\nand perilous journey. We had neither to fear fatiguing heat nor\ndrenching rain. It was, in fact, real tourist weather.\nAs there was nothing I liked better than horse exercise, the pleasure of\nriding through an unknown country caused the early part of our\nenterprise to be particularly agreeable to me.\nI began to enjoy the exhilarating delight of traveling, a life of\ndesire, gratification and liberty. The truth is, that my spirits rose so\nrapidly, that I began to be indifferent to what had once appeared to be\na terrible journey.\n\"After all,\" I said to myself, \"what do I risk? Simply to take a journey\nthrough a curious country, to climb a remarkable mountain, and if the\nworst comes to the worst, to descend into the crater of an extinct\nvolcano.\"\nThere could be no doubt that this was all this terrible Saknussemm had\ndone. As to the existence of a gallery, or of subterraneous passages\nleading into the interior of the earth, the idea was simply absurd, the\nhallucination of a distempered imagination. All, then, that may be\nrequired of me I will do cheerfully, and will create no difficulty.\nIt was just before we left Reykjavik that I came to this decision.\nHans, our extraordinary guide, went first, walking with a steady, rapid,\nunvarying step. Our two horses with the luggage followed of their own\naccord, without requiring whip or spur. My uncle and I came behind,\ncutting a very tolerable figure upon our small but vigorous animals.\nIceland is one of the largest islands in Europe. It contains thirty\nthousand square miles of surface, and has about seventy thousand\ninhabitants. Geographers have divided it into four parts, and we had to\ncross the southwest quarter which in the vernacular is called Sudvestr\nFjordungr.\nHans, on taking his departure from Reykjavik, had followed the line of\nthe sea. We took our way through poor and sparse meadows, which made a\ndesperate effort every year to show a little green. They very rarely\nsucceed in a good show of yellow.\nThe rugged summits of the rocky hills were dimly visible on the edge of\nthe horizon, through the misty fogs; every now and then some heavy\nflakes of snow showed conspicuous in the morning light, while certain\nlofty and pointed rocks were first lost in the grey low clouds, their\nsummits clearly visible above, like jagged reefs rising from a troublous\nsea.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 25\nTHE WHISPERING GALLERY\nWhen at last I came back to a sense of life and being, my face was wet,\nbut wet, as I soon knew, with tears. How long this state of\ninsensibility lasted, it is quite impossible for me now to say. I had no\nmeans left to me of taking any account of time. Never since the creation\nof the world had such a solitude as mine existed. I was completely\nabandoned.\nAfter my fall I lost much blood. I felt myself flooded with the\nlife-giving liquid. My first sensation was perhaps a natural one. Why\nwas I not dead? Because I was alive, there was something left to do. I\ntried to make up my mind to think no longer. As far as I was able, I\ndrove away all ideas, and utterly overcome by pain and grief, I crouched\nagainst the granite wall.\nI just commenced to feel the fainting coming on again, and the sensation\nthat this was the last struggle before complete annihilation--when, on a\nsudden, a violent uproar reached my ears. It had some resemblance to the\nprolonged rumbling voice of thunder, and I clearly distinguished\nsonorous voices, lost one after the other, in the distant depths of the\ngulf.\nWhence came this noise? Naturally, it was to be supposed from new\nphenomena which were taking place in the bosom of the solid mass of\nMother Earth! The explosion of some gaseous vapors, or the fall of some\nsolid, of the granitic or other rock.\nAgain I listened with deep attention. I was extremely anxious to hear if\nthis strange and inexplicable sound was likely to be renewed! A whole\nquarter of an hour elapsed in painful expectation. Deep and solemn\nsilence reigned in the tunnel. So still that I could hear the beatings\nof my own heart! I waited, waited with a strange kind of hopefulness.\nSuddenly my ear, which leaned accidentally against the wall, appeared to\ncatch, as it were, the faintest echo of a sound. I thought that I heard\nvague, incoherent and distant voices. I quivered all over with\nexcitement and hope!\n\"It must be hallucination,\" I cried. \"It cannot be! it is not true!\"\nBut no! By listening more attentively, I really did convince myself that\nwhat I heard was truly the sound of human voices. To make any meaning\nout of the sound, however, was beyond my power. I was too weak even to\nhear distinctly. Still it was a positive fact that someone was speaking.\nOf that I was quite certain.\nThere was a moment of fear. A dread fell upon my soul that it might be\nmy own words brought back to me by a distant echo. Perhaps without\nknowing it, I might have been crying aloud. I resolutely closed my lips,\nand once more placed my ear to the huge granite wall.\nYes, for certain. It was in truth the sound of human voices.\nI now by the exercise of great determination dragged myself along the\nsides of the cavern, until I reached a point where I could hear more\ndistinctly. But though I could detect the sound, I could only make out\nuncertain, strange, and incomprehensible words. They reached my ear as\nif they had been spoken in a low tone--murmured, as it were, afar off.\nAt last, I made out the word forlorad repeated several times in a tone\nbetokening great mental anguish and sorrow.\nWhat could this word mean, and who was speaking it? It must be either my\nuncle or the guide Hans! If, therefore, I could hear them, they must\nsurely be able to hear me.\n\"Help,\" I cried at the top of my voice; \"help, I am dying!\"\nI then listened with scarcely a breath; I panted for the slightest sound\nin the darkness--a cry, a sigh, a question! But silence reigned supreme.\nNo answer came! In this way some minutes passed. A whole flood of ideas\nflashed through my mind. I began to fear that my voice, weakened by\nsickness and suffering, could not reach my companions who were in search\nof me.\n\"It must be they,\" I cried; \"who else could by any possibility be buried\na hundred miles below the level of the earth?\" The mere supposition was\npreposterous.\nI began, therefore, to listen again with the most breathless attention.\nAs I moved my ears along the side of the place I was in, I found a\nmathematical point as it were, where the voices appeared to attain their\nmaximum of intensity. The word forlorad again distinctly reached my ear.\nThen came again that rolling noise like thunder which had awakened me\nout of torpor.\n\"I begin to understand,\" I said to myself after some little time devoted\nto reflection; \"it is not through the solid mass that the sound reaches\nmy ears. The walls of my cavernous retreat are of solid granite, and the\nmost fearful explosion would not make uproar enough to penetrate them.\nThe sound must come along the gallery itself. The place I was in must\npossess some peculiar acoustic properties of its own.\"\nAgain I listened; and this time--yes, this time--I heard my name\ndistinctly pronounced: cast as it were into space.\nIt was my uncle, the Professor, who was speaking. He was in conversation\nwith the guide, and the word which had so often reached my ears,\nforlorad, was a Danish expression.\nThen I understood it all. In order to make myself heard, I too must\nspeak as it were along the side of the gallery, which would carry the\nsound of my voice just as the wire carries the electric fluid from point\nto point.\nBut there was no time to lose. If my companions were only to remove a\nfew feet from where they stood, the acoustic effect would be over, my\nWhispering Gallery would be destroyed. I again therefore crawled towards\nthe wall, and said as clearly and distinctly as I could:\n\"Uncle Hardwigg.\"\nI then awaited a reply.\nSound does not possess the property of traveling with such extreme\nrapidity. Besides the density of the air at that depth from light and\nmotion was very far from adding to the rapidity of circulation. Several\nseconds elapsed, which to my excited imagination, appeared ages; and\nthese words reached my eager ears, and moved my wildly beating heart:\n\"Harry, my boy, is that you?\"\nA short delay between question and answer.\n\"Yes--yes.\"\n..........\n\"Where are you?\"\n..........\n\"Lost!\"\n..........\n\"And your lamp?\"\n..........\n\"Out.\"\n..........\n\"But the guiding stream?\"\n..........\n\"Is lost!\"\n..........\n\"Keep your courage, Harry. We will do our best.\"\n..........\n\"One moment, my uncle,\" I cried; \"I have no longer strength to answer\nyour questions. But--for heaven's sake--do you--continue--to speak--to\nme!\" Absolute silence, I felt, would be annihilation.\n\"Keep up your courage,\" said my uncle. \"As you are so weak, do not\nspeak. We have been searching for you in all directions, both by going\nupwards and downwards in the gallery. My dear boy, I had begun to give\nover all hope--and you can never know what bitter tears of sorrow and\nregret I have shed. At last, supposing you to be still on the road\nbeside the Hansbach, we again descended, firing off guns as signals.\nNow, however, that we have found you, and that our voices reach each\nother, it may be a long time before we actually meet. We are conversing\nby means of some extraordinary acoustic arrangement of the labyrinth.\nBut do not despair, my dear boy. It is something gained even to hear\neach other.\"\nWhile he was speaking, my brain was at work reflecting. A certain\nundefined hope, vague and shapeless as yet, made my heart beat wildly.\nIn the first place, it was absolutely necessary for me to know one\nthing. I once more, therefore, leaned my head against the wall, which I\nalmost touched with my lips, and again spoke.\n\"Uncle.\"\n..........\n\"My boy?\" was his answer after a few moments.\n..........\n\"It is of the utmost consequence that we should know how far we are\nasunder.\"\n..........\n\"That is not difficult.\"\n..........\n\"You have your chronometer at hand?\" I asked.\n..........\n\"Certainly.\"\n..........\n\"Well, take it into your hand. Pronounce my name, noting exactly the\nsecond at which you speak. I will reply as soon as I hear your\nwords--and you will then note exactly the moment at which my reply\nreaches you.\"\n..........\n\"Very good; and the mean time between my question and your answer will\nbe the time occupied by my voice in reaching you.\"\n..........\n\"That is exactly what I mean, Uncle,\" was my eager reply.\n..........\n\"Are you ready?\"\n..........\n\"Yes.\"\n..........\n\"Well, make ready, I am about to pronounce your name,\" said the\nProfessor.\nI applied my ear close to the sides of the cavernous gallery, and as\nsoon as the word \"Harry\" reached my ear, I turned round and, placing my\nlips to the wall, repeated the sound.\n..........\n\"Forty seconds,\" said my uncle. \"There has elapsed forty seconds between\nthe two words. The sound, therefore, takes twenty seconds to ascend.\nNow, allowing a thousand and twenty feet for every second--we have\ntwenty thousand four hundred feet--a league and a half and one-eighth.\"\nThese words fell on my soul like a kind of death knell.\n\"A league and a half,\" I muttered in a low and despairing voice.\n..........\n\"It shall be got over, my boy,\" cried my uncle in a cheery tone; \"depend\non us.\"\n..........\n\"But do you know whether to ascend or descend?\" I asked faintly enough.\n..........\n\"We have to descend, and I will tell you why. You have reached a vast\nopen space, a kind of bare crossroad, from which galleries diverge in\nevery direction. That in which you are now lying must necessarily bring\nyou to this point, for it appears that all these mighty fissures, these\nfractures of the globe's interior, radiate from the vast cavern which we\nat this moment occupy. Rouse yourself, then, have courage and continue\nyour route. Walk if you can, if not drag yourself along--slide, if\nnothing else is possible. The slope must be rather rapid--and you will\nfind strong arms to receive you at the end of your journey. Make a\nstart, like a good fellow.\"\nThese words served to rouse some kind of courage in my sinking frame.\n\"Farewell for the present, good uncle, I am about to take my departure.\nAs soon as I start, our voices will cease to commingle. Farewell, then,\nuntil we meet again.\"\n..........\n\"Adieu, Harry--until we say Welcome.\" Such were the last words which\nreached my anxious ears before I commenced my weary and almost hopeless\njourney.\nThis wonderful and surprising conversation which took place through the\nvast mass of the earth's labyrinth, these words exchanged, the speakers\nbeing about five miles apart--ended with hopeful and pleasant\nexpressions. I breathed one more prayer to Heaven, I sent up words of\nthanksgiving--believing in my inmost heart that He had led me to the\nonly place where the voices of my friends could reach my ears.\nThis apparently astounding acoustic mystery is easily explainable by\nsimple natural laws; it arose from the conductibility of the rock. There\nare many instances of this singular propagation of sound which are not\nperceptible in its less mediate positions. In the interior gallery of\nSt. Paul's, and amid the curious caverns in Sicily, these phenomena are\nobservable. The most marvelous of them all is known as the Ear of\nDionysius.\nThese memories of the past, of my early reading and studies, came fresh\nto my thoughts. Moreover, I began to reason that if my uncle and I could\ncommunicate at so great a distance, no serious obstacle could exist\nbetween us. All I had to do was to follow the direction whence the sound\nhad reached me; and logically putting it, I must reach him if my\nstrength did not fail.\nI accordingly rose to my feet. I soon found, however, that I could not\nwalk; that I must drag myself along. The slope as I expected was very\nrapid; but I allowed myself to slip down.\nSoon the rapidity of the descent began to assume frightful proportions;\nand menaced a fearful fall. I clutched at the sides; I grasped at\nprojections of rocks; I threw myself backwards. All in vain. My weakness\nwas so great I could do nothing to save myself.\nSuddenly earth failed me.\nI was first launched into a dark and gloomy void. I then struck against\nthe projecting asperities of a vertical gallery, a perfect well. My head\nbounded against a pointed rock, and I lost all knowledge of existence.\nAs far as I was concerned, death had claimed me for his own.\n\n\nCHAPTER 29\nON THE WATERS--A RAFT VOYAGE\nOn the thirteenth of August we were up betimes. There was no time to be\nlost. We now had to inaugurate a new kind of locomotion, which would\nhave the advantage of being rapid and not fatiguing.\nA mast, made of two pieces of wood fastened together, to give additional\nstrength, a yard made from another one, the sail a linen sheet from our\nbed. We were fortunately in no want of cordage, and the whole on trial\nappeared solid and seaworthy.\nAt six o'clock in the morning, when the eager and enthusiastic Professor\ngave the signal to embark, the victuals, the luggage, all our\ninstruments, our weapons, and a goodly supply of sweet water, which we\nhad collected from springs in the rocks, were placed on the raft.\nHans had, with considerable ingenuity, contrived a rudder, which enabled\nhim to guide the floating apparatus with ease. He took the tiller, as a\nmatter of course. The worthy man was as good a sailor as he was a guide\nand duck hunter. I then let go the painter which held us to the shore,\nthe sail was brought to the wind, and we made a rapid offing.\nOur sea voyage had at length commenced; and once more we were making for\ndistant and unknown regions.\nJust as we were about to leave the little port where the raft had been\nconstructed, my uncle, who was very strong as to geographic\nnomenclature, wanted to give it a name, and among others, suggested\nmine.\n\"Well,\" said I, \"before you decide I have another to propose.\"\n\"Well; out with it.\"\n\"I should like to call it Gretchen. Port Gretchen will sound very well\non our future map.\"\n\"Well then, Port Gretchen let it be,\" said the Professor.\nAnd thus it was that the memory of my dear girl was attached to our\nadventurous and memorable expedition.\nWhen we left the shore the wind was blowing from the northward and\neastward. We went directly before the wind at a much greater speed than\nmight have been expected from a raft. The dense layers of atmosphere at\nthat depth had great propelling power and acted upon the sail with\nconsiderable force.\nAt the end of an hour, my uncle, who had been taking careful\nobservations, was enabled to judge of the rapidity with which we moved.\nIt was far beyond anything seen in the upper world.\n\"If,\" he said, \"we continue to advance at our present rate, we shall\nhave traveled at least thirty leagues in twenty-four hours. With a mere\nraft this is an almost incredible velocity.\"\nI certainly was surprised, and without making any reply went forward\nupon the raft. Already the northern shore was fading away on the edge of\nthe horizon. The two shores appeared to separate more and more, leaving\na wide and open space for our departure. Before me I could see nothing\nbut the vast and apparently limitless sea--upon which we floated--the\nonly living objects in sight.\nHuge and dark clouds cast their grey shadows below--shadows which seemed\nto crush that colorless and sullen water by their weight. Anything more\nsuggestive of gloom and of regions of nether darkness I never beheld.\nSilvery rays of electric light, reflected here and there upon some small\nspots of water, brought up luminous sparkles in the long wake of our\ncumbrous bark. Presently we were wholly out of sight of land; not a\nvestige could be seen, nor any indication of where we were going. So\nstill and motionless did we seem without any distant point to fix our\neyes on that but for the phosphoric light at the wake of the raft I\nshould have fancied that we were still and motionless.\nBut I knew that we were advancing at a very rapid rate.\nAbout twelve o'clock in the day, vast collections of seaweed were\ndiscovered surrounding us on all sides. I was aware of the extraordinary\nvegetative power of these plants, which have been known to creep along\nthe bottom of the great ocean, and stop the advance of large ships. But\nnever were seaweeds ever seen, so gigantic and wonderful as those of the\nCentral Sea. I could well imagine how, seen at a distance, tossing and\nheaving on the summit of the billows, the long lines of algae have been\ntaken for living things, and thus have been fertile sources of the\nbelief in sea serpents.\nOur raft swept past great specimens of fucus or seawrack, from three to\nfour thousand feet in length, immense, incredibly long, looking like\nsnakes that stretched out far beyond our horizon. It afforded me great\namusement to gaze on their variegated ribbon-like endless lengths. Hour\nafter hour passed without our coming to the termination of these\nfloating weeds. If my astonishment increased, my patience was well-nigh\nexhausted.\nWhat natural force could possibly have produced such abnormal and\nextraordinary plants? What must have been the aspect of the globe,\nduring the first centuries of its formation, when under the combined\naction of heat and humidity, the vegetable kingdom occupied its vast\nsurface to the exclusion of everything else?\nThese were considerations of never-ending interest for the geologist and\nthe philosopher.\nAll this while we were advancing on our journey; and at length night\ncame; but as I had remarked the evening before, the luminous state of\nthe atmosphere was in nothing diminished. Whatever was the cause, it was\na phenomenon upon the duration of which we could calculate with\ncertainty.\nAs soon as our supper had been disposed of, and some little speculative\nconversation indulged in, I stretched myself at the foot of the mast,\nand presently went to sleep.\nHans remained motionless at the tiller, allowing the raft to rise and\nfall on the waves. The wind being aft, and the sail square, all he had\nto do was to keep his oar in the centre.\nEver since we had taken our departure from the newly named Port\nGretchen, my worthy uncle had directed me to keep a regular log of our\nday's navigation, with instructions to put down even the most minute\nparticulars, every interesting and curious phenomenon, the direction of\nthe wind, our rate of sailing, the distance we went; in a word, every\nincident of our extraordinary voyage.\nFrom our log, therefore, I tell the story of our voyage on the Central\nSea.\nFriday, August 14th. A steady breeze from the northwest. Raft\nprogressing with extreme rapidity, and going perfectly straight. Coast\nstill dimly visible about thirty leagues to leeward. Nothing to be seen\nbeyond the horizon in front. The extraordinary intensity of the light\nneither increases nor diminishes. It is singularly stationary. The\nweather remarkably fine; that is to say, the clouds have ascended very\nhigh, and are light and fleecy, and surrounded by an atmosphere\nresembling silver in fusion.\nThermometer, +32 degrees centigrade.\nAbout twelve o'clock in the day our guide Hans having prepared and\nbaited a hook, cast his line into the subterranean waters. The bait he\nused was a small piece of meat, by means of which he concealed his hook.\nAnxious as I was, I was for a long time doomed to disappointment. Were\nthese waters supplied with fish or not? That was the important question.\nNo--was my decided answer. Then there came a sudden and rather hard tug.\nHans coolly drew it in, and with it a fish, which struggled violently to\nescape.\n\"A fish!\" cried my uncle.\n\"It is a sturgeon!\" I cried, \"certainly a small sturgeon.\"\nThe Professor examined the fish carefully, noting every characteristic;\nand he did not coincide in my opinion. The fish had a flat head, round\nbody, and the lower extremities covered with bony scales; its mouth was\nwholly without teeth, the pectoral fins, which were highly developed,\nsprouted direct from the body, which properly speaking had no tail. The\nanimal certainly belonged to the order in which naturalists class the\nsturgeon, but it differed from that fish in many essential particulars.\nMy uncle, after all, was not mistaken. After a long and patient\nexamination\nThe whole panorama of the world's life before the historic period,\nseemed to be born over again, and mine was the only human heart that\nbeat in this unpeopled world! There were no more seasons; there were no\nmore climates; the natural heat of the world increased unceasingly, and\nneutralized that of the great radiant Sun.\nVegetation was exaggerated in an extraordinary manner. I passed like a\nshadow in the midst of brushwood as lofty as the giant trees of\nCalifornia, and trod underfoot the moist and humid soil, reeking with a\nrank and varied vegetation.\nI leaned against the huge column-like trunks of giant trees, to which\nthose of Canada were as ferns. Whole ages passed, hundreds upon hundreds\nof years were concentrated into a single day.\nNext, unrolled before me like a panorama, came the great and wondrous\nseries of terrestrial transformations. Plants disappeared; the granitic\nrocks lost all trace of solidity; the liquid state was suddenly\nsubstituted for that which had before existed. This was caused by\nintense heat acting on the organic matter of the earth. The waters\nflowed over the whole surface of the globe; they boiled; they were\nvolatilized, or turned into vapor; a kind of steam cloud wrapped the\nwhole earth, the globe itself becoming at last nothing but one huge\nsphere of gas, indescribable in color, between white heat and red, as\nbig and as brilliant as the sun.\nIn the very centre of this prodigious mass, fourteen hundred thousand\ntimes as large as our globe, I was whirled round in space, and brought\ninto close conjunction with the planets. My body was subtilized, or\nrather became volatile, and commingled in a state of atomic vapor, with\nthe prodigious clouds, which rushed forward like a mighty comet into\ninfinite space!\nWhat an extraordinary dream! Where would it finally take me? My feverish\nhand began to write down the marvelous details--details more like the\nimaginings of a lunatic than anything sober and real. I had during this\nperiod of hallucination forgotten everything--the Professor, the guide,\nand the raft on which we were floating. My mind was in a state of\nsemioblivion.\nCHAPTER 30\nTERRIFIC SAURIAN COMBAT\nSaturday, August 15th. The sea still retains its uniform monotony. The\nsame leaden hue, the same eternal glare from above. No indication of\nland being in sight. The horizon appears to retreat before us, more and\nmore as we advance.\nMy head, still dull and heavy from the effects of my extraordinary\ndream, which I cannot as yet banish from my mind.\nThe Professor, who has not dreamed, is, however, in one of his morose\nand unaccountable humors. Spends his time in scanning the horizon, at\nevery point of the compass. His telescope is raised every moment to his\neyes, and when he finds nothing to give any clue to our whereabouts, he\nassumes a Napoleonic attitude and walks anxiously.\nI remarked that my uncle, the Professor, had a strong tendency to resume\nhis old impatient character, and I could not but make a note of this\ndisagreeable circumstance in my journal. I saw clearly that it had\nrequired all the influence of my danger and suffering, to extract from\nhim one scintillation of humane feeling. Now that I was quite recovered,\nhis original nature had conquered and obtained the upper hand.\nAnd, after all, what had he to be angry and annoyed about, now more than\nat any other time? Was not the journey being accomplished under the most\nfavorable circumstances? Was not the raft progressing with the most\nmarvelous rapidity?\nWhat, then, could be the matter? After one or two preliminary hems, I\ndetermined to inquire.\nAfter this I thought it well to hold my tongue, and allow the Professor\nto bite his lips until the blood came, without further remark.\nAt six o'clock in the evening, our matter-of-fact guide, Hans, asked for\nhis week's salary, and receiving his three rix-dollars, put them\ncarefully in his pocket. He was perfectly contented and satisfied.\nSunday, August 16th. Nothing new to record. The same weather as before.\nThe wind has a slight tendency to freshen up, with signs of an\napproaching gale. When I awoke, my first observation was in regard to\nthe intensity of the light. I keep on fearing, day after day, that the\nextraordinary electric phenomenon should become first obscured, and then\ngo wholly out, leaving us in total darkness. Nothing, however, of the\nkind occurs. The shadow of the raft, its mast and sails, is clearly\ndistinguished on the surface of the water.\nThis wondrous sea is, after all, infinite in its extent. It must be\nquite as wide as the Mediterranean--or perhaps even as the great\nAtlantic Ocean. Why, after all, should it not be so?\nMy uncle has on more than one occasion, tried deep-sea soundings. He\ntied the cross of one of our heaviest crowbars to the extremity of a\ncord, which he allowed to run out to the extent of two hundred fathoms.\nWe had the greatest difficulty in hoisting in our novel kind of lead.\nWhen the crowbar was finally dragged on board, Hans called my attention\nto some singular marks upon its surface. The piece of iron looked as if\nit had been crushed between two very hard substances.\nI looked at our worthy guide with an inquiring glance.\n\"Tander,\" said he.\nOn that spot, some three square miles in extent, was accumulated the\nwhole history of animal life--scarcely one creature upon the\ncomparatively modern soil of the upper and inhabited world had not there\nexisted.\nNevertheless, we were drawn forward by an all-absorbing and impatient\ncuriosity. Our feet crushed with a dry and crackling sound the remains\nof those prehistoric fossils, for which the museums of great cities\nquarrel, even when they obtain only rare and curious morsels. A thousand\nsuch naturalists as Cuvier would not have sufficed to recompose the\nskeletons of the organic beings which lay in this magnificent osseous\ncollection.\nI was utterly confounded. My uncle stood for some minutes with his arms\nraised on high towards the thick granite vault which served us for a\nsky. His mouth was wide open; his eyes sparkled wildly behind his\nspectacles (which he had fortunately saved), his head bobbed up and down\nand from side to side, while his whole attitude and mien expressed\nunbounded astonishment.\n",

Winter\n\n[Sidenote: Ken Torrance races Poleward to the aid of the submarine\n_Peary_, trapped in an icy limbo of avenging sealmen.]\nCHAPTER I\n_An Empty Room_\nThe house where the long trail started was one of gray walls, gray\nrooms and gray corridors, with carpets that muffled the feet which at\nintervals passed along them. It was a house of silence, brooding\nwithin the high fence that shut it and the grounds from a landscape\ntorpid under the hot sun of summer, and across which occasionally\ndrifted the lonely, mournful whistle of a train on a nearby railroad.\nInside the house there was always a hush, a heavy quiet--restful to\nthe brain.\nBut now a voice was raised, young, angry, impatient, in one of the\ngray-walled rooms.\n\"Yes, I rang for you. I want my bags packed. I'm leaving this\nminute!\"\nThe face of the man who had entered showed surprise.\n\"Leaving, Mr. Torrance? Why?\"\n\"Read this!\"\n[Illustration: _She was fastened in the mud of the gloomy sea-floor._]\nAs if, knowing and therefore dreading what he would see, the attendant\ntook the newspaper held outstretched to him and followed the pointing\nfinger to a featured column. He scanned it:\n   Deadline Passed for Missing Submarine\n Point Barrow, Aug. 17 (AP): Planes sent out to search for\n the missing polar submarine _Peary_ have returned without\n clue to the mystery of is disappearance. The close search\n that has been conducted through the last two weeks,\n involving great risks to the pilots, has been fruitless, and\n authorities now hold out small hope for Captain Sallorsen,\n his crew and the several scientists who accompanied the\n daring expedition.\n If the _Peary_, as is generally thought, is trapped beneath\n the ice floes or embedded in the deep silt of the polar\n sea-floor, her margin of safety has passed the deadline, it\n was pointed out to-day by her designers. Through special\n rectifiers aboard, her store of air can be kept capable of\n sustaining life for a theoretical period of thirty-one days.\n And exactly thirty-one days have now elapsed since last the\n _Peary's_ radio was heard from a position 72° 47' N, 162°\n 22' W, some twelve hundred miles from the North Pole itself.\n In official circles, hope was practically abandoned for the\n missing submarine, though attempts will continue to be made\n to locate her....\n\"I'm sorry, Mr. Torrance,\" said the attendant nervously. \"This paper\nshould--\"\n\"Should never have reached me, eh? Through some slip of the people who\ncensor my reading matter here, I read what I wasn't supposed\nto--that's what you mean?\"\n\"It was thought better, Mr. Torrance, by the doctors, and--\"\n\"Good God! Thought better! Through their sagacity, these doctors have\nprobably condemned the men on this submarine to death! I haven't heard\na word about the expedition; didn't even know the _Peary_ was up\nthere, much less missing!\"\n\"Well, Mr. Torrance,\" the attendant stammered, more and more\nunsettled, \"the doctors thought that--that any news about it\nwould--well, upset you.\"\nThe young man laughed bitterly;\n\"Bring on my old 'trouble,' I suppose. The doctors have been\nconsiderate, but I won't concern them any more. I'm through. I'm\nleaving for the north--right now. There's a bare chance I might still\nbe in time.\"\n\"I'm sorry, Mr. Torrance, but you can't.\"\n\"Can't?\"\nThe attendant had retreated to the door. His eyes were nervous, his\nface pale.\n\"It's orders, Mr. Torrance. You've been under observation treatment,\nand the doctors left strict orders that you must stay.\"\nThe young man throbbed with dangerous anger. His hands clenched and\nunclenched. He burst out, in a last attempt at reason:\n\"But don't you see, I've _got_ to get to the _Peary_! It's the last\nhope for those men! The position she was last heard from is right\nwhere I--\"\n\"You can't leave, Mr. Torrance! I'm sorry, but I'll have to call a\nguard!\"\nFor a minute their eyes held. With an effort, the young man said more\ncalmly:\n\"I see. I see. I'm a prisoner. All right, leave me.\"\nThe attendant was more than willing. The young man heard the door's\nlock click. And then he lowered his head and pressed his hands hard\ninto his face.\nBut a second later he was looking up again, at the single wide window\nwhich gave out on the lonely landscape over which sometimes came\ndrifting the distant cry of a train's whistle.\n  *  *  *  *  *\nTwo months before, Kenneth Torrance had returned to the whaling\nsubmarine _Narwhal_, of which he was first torpooner, with a confused\nstory of men who were half-seals that lived in mounds under the Arctic\nice,[1] who had captured him and--he found--had also captured the\nsecond torpooner, Chanley Beddoes. In breaking free from their\nmound-prison, Beddoes had killed one of the sealmen and had been\nhimself slain minutes later by a killer whale, one of the fierce\nscavengers of the sea which the sealmen trapped for food even as the\n_Narwhal_ sought them for oil. Ken Torrance alone came back.\n[Footnote 1: See the February, 1932, issue of Astounding Stories.]\nOver their doubts, he had stuck to his story. Later, he had repeated\nit to officials of the Alaska Whaling Company, who worked the\nsubmarine and several surface ships. They in return had sent him to a\nprivate sanitarium in the State of Washington for a rest which they\nhoped would \"iron out the kink\" in his brain.\nHere Ken had been for six weeks, while the exploring submarine _Peary_\nnosed her way northward toward the Pole. Here he had been, all\nunknowing, while the world hummed with reports of the _Peary's_\ndisappearance in that far-off ever-shrouded sea of mystery.\nShe might, Ken knew, have struck a shaft of underwater ice, sending\nher to the bottom; some of her machinery might have cracked up,\nparalyzing her; the ice-fields under which she cruised might have\nshifted suddenly, crushing her ribs--of these perils the world knew as\nwell as he. But the submarine's crew was prepared for them; the\n_Peary_ was equipped with a circular saw for cutting up through the\nice from beneath, and she carried sea-suits which would allow her men,\nif she were wrecked on the bottom, to leave her and get up on the ice\nand wait for the first searching plane.\nWhy, then, had not the planes which scoured the region found the\nsurvivors?\nThat was the mystery--but not to Ken Torrance. There was another\nperil, of which he alone knew. Not far from where the _Peary's_ last\nradio report had come, a group of hollowed-out mounds lay on the\nsea-floor, swarming with brown-skinned, quick-swimming creatures.\nSealmen, they were--men who, like the seals, had gone back to the sea.\nMonths ago, Second Torpooner Chanley Beddoes had killed one of them.\nThey were intelligent; they could remember; they were capable of hate\nand fear; they would be desirous of leveling the debt!\nThere, Ken felt sure, lay the reason for the _Peary's_ baffling\nsilence, for the non-appearance of her men.\nThere might still be time. No one of course would listen to him and\nbelieve, so he would have to go in search of the _Peary_ and her crew\nhimself.\nStanding by the window, Kenneth Torrance quickly planned the several\nsteps which would take him to the Arctic and its silent ice-coated\nsea.\nAnd when, some two hours later, after a short warning rap on the door,\nthe individual who served as Mr. Torrance's attendant entered his\nroom, he was confronted, not by the gentleman whose dinner he carried,\nbut by an empty room, a stripped bed, an open window, and a rope of\nsheets dangling from it toward the ground two stories beneath.\nThat was at seven o'clock in the evening.\nCHAPTER II\n_The Crash_\nAt a few minutes before eight o'clock, Air Mail Pilot Steve Chapman\nwas enjoying a quiet cigarette while waiting for the mechanics to warm\nup the five hundred horses of his mail plane satisfactorily. Halfway\nthrough, he heard, from behind, a quick patter of feet, and, turning,\nhe observed a figure clad in flannel trousers and sweater. The\ncigarette dropped right out of his mouth as he cried:\n\"Ken! Ken Torrance!\"\n\"Thank God you're here!\" said Kenneth Torrance. \"I gambled on it.\nSteve, I've got to borrow your own personal plane.\"\n\"What?\" gasped Steve Chapman. \"What--what--?\"\n\"Listen, Steve. I haven't been with the whaling company lately; been\nresting, down here--secluded. Didn't know that submarine, the _Peary_,\nwas missing. I just learned. And I know damned well what's happened to\nit. I've got to get to it, quick is I can, and I've got to have a\nplane.\"\nSteve Chapman said rather faintly:\n\"But--where was the _Peary_ when they last heard from her?\"\n\"Some twelve hundred miles from the Pole.\"\n\"And you want to get there in a plane? From here?\"\n\"Must!\"\n\"Boy, you stand about one chance in twenty!\"\n\"Have to take it. Time's precious, Steve. I've got to stop in at the\nAlaska Whaling Company's outpost at Point Christensen, then right on\nup. I can't even begin unless I have a plane. You've got to help me on\nmy one chance of bringing the _Peary's_ men out alive! You'll probably\nnever see the plane again, Steve, but--\"\n\"To hell with the plane, if you come through with yourself and those\nmen,\" said the pilot. \"All right, kid, I don't get it all, but I'm\nplaying with you. You're taking my own ship.\"\nHe led Ken to a hangar wherein stood a trim five-passenger amphibian;\nand very soon that amphibian was roaring out her deep-throated song of\npower on the line, itching for the air, and Steve Chapman was shouting\na few last words up to the muffled figure in the enclosed control\ncockpit.\n\"Fuel'll last around forty hours,\" he finished. \"You'll find two\nhundred per, easy, and twenty-five hours should take you clear to\nPoint Christensen. I put gun and maps in the right pocket; food in\nthat flap behind you. Go to it, Ken!\"\nKen Torrance gripped the hand outstretched to his and held it tight.\nHe could say nothing, could only nod--this was a real friend. He gave\nthe ship the gun.\nHer mighty Diesel bellowed, lashed the air down and under; the\namphibian spun her retractable wheels over the straight hard ground\nuntil they lifted lightly and tilted upward in a slow climb for\naltitude. With fiery streams from the exhaust lashing her flanks, she\nfaded into the darkness to the north.\n\"Well,\" murmured Steve Chapman, \"I've got her instalments left,\nanyway!\" And he grinned and turned to the mail.\n  *  *  *  *  *\nThat night passed slowly by; and the next day; and all through night\nand day the steady roar of beating cylinders hung in Kenneth\nTorrance's ears. At last came Point Christensen and a descent; sleep\nand then quick, decisive action; and again the amphibian rose, heavily\nloaded now, and droned on toward the ice and the cold bleak skies of\nthe far north. On, ever on, until Point Barrow, Alaska's northernmost\nspur, was left behind to the east, and the world was one of drifting\nice on gray water. Muscles cramped, mind dulled by the everlasting\nroar, head aching and weary, Ken held the amphibian to her steady\ncourse, until a sudden wind shook her momentarily from it.\nA rising wind. The skies were ugly. And then he remembered that the\nmen at Point Christensen had warned him of a storm that was brewing.\nThey'd told him that he was heading into disaster; and their\nsurprised, rather fearful faces appeared before him again, as he had\nseen them just before taking off, after he had told them where he was\ngoing.\nOf course they'd thought him crazy. He had brought the amphibian down\nin the little harbor off the whaling company's base, gone ashore and\ngreeted his old friends. There was only a handful of men stationed\nthere; the _Narwhal_ was being overhauled in a shipyard at San\nFrancisco, and it wasn't the season for surface whalers. They knew\nthat he, Ken, had been put in a sanitarium; all of them had heard his\nwild story about sealmen. But he concocted a plausible yarn to account\nfor his arrival, and they had fed him and given him a berth in the\nbunkhouse for the night.\nFor the night! Ken Torrance grinned as he recalled the scene. In the\nmiddle of the night he had risen, quickly awakened four of the\nsleeping men, and with his gun forced them to take a torpoon from the\noutpost's storehouse and put it inside the amphibian's passenger\ncompartment.\nIt was robbery, and of course they'd thought him insane, but they\ndidn't dare cross him. He had told them cheerfully he was going after\nthe _Peary_, and that if they wanted the torpoon back they were to\ndirect the searching planes to keep their eyes on the place where the\nsubmarine was last heard from....\n  *  *  *  *  *\nKen came back to the present abruptly as the plane lurched. The wind\nwas getting nasty. At least he did not have much farther to go; an\nhour's flying time would take him to his goal, where he must descend\ninto the water to continue his search. His search! Had it been, he\nwondered, a useless one from the start? Had the submarine's crew been\nkilled before he'd even read of her disappearance? If the sealmen got\nthem, would they destroy them immediately?\n\"I doubt it,\" Ken muttered to himself. \"They'd be kept prisoners in\none of those mounds, like I was. That is, if they haven't killed any\nof the creatures. It hangs on that!\"\nAn hour's time, he had reckoned; but it was more than an hour. For\nsoon the world was blotted out by a howling dervish of wind and driven\nsnow that time and time again snatched the amphibian from Ken's\ncontrol and hurled it high, or threw it down like a toy toward the\ninferno of sea and ice he knew lay beneath. He fought for altitude,\nfor direction, pitched from side to side, tumbled forward and back,\ngaining a few hundred feet only to feel them plucked breathtakingly\nout from under him as the screaming wind played with him.\nNow and again he snatched a glance at the torpoon behind. The\ngleaming, twelve-foot, cigar-shaped craft, with its directional\nrudders, propeller, vision-plate and nitro-shell gun lay safely\nsecured in the passenger compartment, a familiar and reassuring sight\nto Ken, who, as first torpooner of the _Narwhal_, had worked one for\nyears in the chase for killer whales. Soon, it seemed, he would have\nto depend on it for his life.\nFor all the Diesel's power, it was not enough to cope with the dead\nweight of ice which was forming over the plane's wings and fuselage.\nHe could not keep the altimeter up. However he fought, Ken saw that\nfinger drop down, down--up a trifle, quivering as the racked plane\nquivered--and then down and down some more.\nHe saw that the plane was doomed. He would have to abandon it--in the\ntorpoon--if he could.\nHe was some thirty miles from his objective. The sea beneath would be\nhalf hidden under ragged, drifting floes. In fair weather he could\nhave chosen a landing space of clear water, but now he could not\nchoose. The altitude dial said that the water was three hundred feet\nbeneath, and rapidly rising nearer.\nA margin of seconds in which to prepare! Ken locked the controls and\nscrambled back into the passenger compartment. Steadying himself on\nthe bucking floor, he opened the torpoon's entrance port and slid in;\nquickly he locked the port and strapped the inner body harness around\nhim; and then he waited.\nNow it was all chance. If the plane crashed into clear water, he was\nsafe; but if she hit ice.... He put that thought from him.\nThe locked controls held the amphibian for perhaps thirty seconds.\nThen with a scream the storm-giant took her. A mad up-current of wind\nhurled her high, whirled her dizzily, toyed with her--and then she\nspun and dove. Down, down, down; down with a speed so wild Ken grew\nfaint; down through the core of a maelstrom of snow till she crashed.\nKenneth Torrance knew a sudden shaking impact; for an instant there\nwas uncertainty; and then came all-pervading quiet....\nCHAPTER III.\n_The Fate of the Peary_\nQuiet, and utter, liquid darkness.\nLiquid! Around him, Ken heard a gurgling, at first loud and close,\nthen subsiding to a low whispering of currents. The amphibian had hit\nwater.\nGone in an instant was the shriek and fury of the storm and in its\nplace the calm, slow-heaving silence of underwater. The plane was\nshattered in a dozen places, but the torpoon had easily stood it.\nKen turned to action. He switched on the torpoon's dashboard lights\nand twin bow-beams, and saw that the shell was wedged in the fuselage.\nThe plane was apparently entirely under the surface, and her interior\nfilled with water.\nHolding the propeller in neutral, he revved up the powerful electric\nmotor. Then he bit the propeller in, slowly. The torpoon nudged back\nfor inches. Then, throwing the gear into forward, Ken gave her full\nspeed. The torpoon leaped ahead, crunched through the weakened corner\nahead and was free.\nIt was a world of drab tones that she came into. Down below was\nimpenetrable blackness, shading softly overhead into blue-gray which\nwas mottled by lighter areas from breaks in the floes above. All was\ncalm. There was no sign of life save for an occasional vague shadow\nthat, melting swiftly away, might have been a fish or seaweed. Placid\nalways, would be this shrouded sea of mystery, no matter what furious\ntempest raged above over the flat leagues of ice and water.\nBut the seeming peacefulness was but a mask for danger. Kenneth\nTorrance's face was set in sober lines as he sped the slim torpoon\nnorthward, her bow lights shafting long white fingers before her. For\nnow there was only one path--and that lay ahead. He could not turn\nback. Storm and water had destroyed the plane that could take him back\nto land. He could not possibly reach any outpost of civilization in\nthe torpoon, for her cruising radius was only twenty hours. He had\nplanned to land the amphibian on the ice above the spot where the\n_Peary_ had disappeared, then find a break in the ice and slide down\nbelow in the torpoon on his quest--to return to the plane if it proved\nfruitless. But now there was no retreat. It was succeed, or die.\nAnd with that realization a more dreadful thought flashed into his\nmind. All those men, of the whaling company and the sanitarium,\nthought him a little crazy. And, since lunatics are always convinced\nof the reality of their visions, what if the sealmen--his adventure\namidst them--had been but a dream, a nightmare, an hallucination? What\nif he were in truth crazy? The fear grew rapidly. What if he were?\nGod! He, hunting for the _Peary_, when all those planes and men had\nfailed! He, expecting to achieve what those searchers, with far\ngreater resources, had not been able to! Did not that give evidence\nthat his mind was twisted? Creatures, half-seal, half-men, living\nunder the ice--it certainly seemed a lunatic's obsession.\nThen something within him rose and fought back.\n\"No!\" he cried aloud. \"I'll go bugs if I think like that! Those\nsealmen were real--and I know where they are. I'm going on!\"\nAnd, an hour later, the dashboard's shaded dials told him he was on\nthe exact spot where the _Peary_ had last reported....\n  *  *  *  *  *\nHere was the real Arctic, the real polar sea. No sun, no breath of the\nworld above could reach it through its eternal mask of solid ice. As\none of the few unfamiliar aspects of the earth, it was as far removed\nfrom the imagination of man as if it were part of a far planet hung\nspinning millions of miles out in space. Men could reach it in shells\nof metal, but it was not meant for him, and was always hostile. A\ndozen times a daring one could cross safely its cold lonely reaches,\nbut the thirteenth time it would snare and destroy him for the\nunwanted trespasser he was.\nIt was here that the _Peary_ had stepped off into mystery. At this\npoint her hull had throbbed with air, movement, life; at this point\nall had been well. And then, minutes or hours later, close to here,\nthe sea devil had sprung.\nWhat had happened? What had trapped her? What, even more baffling, had\nkept her men with their manifold safety devices from even reaching and\nclimbing up on the ice above to signal the searching planes?\nKen Torrance, oppressively alone in the hovering torpoon, gazed\nthrough its vision-plate of fused quartz around him. Gray sea,\nfiltering to black beneath; distant eerie shadows, probably meaning\nnothing, but possibly all important; ceiling of thick ice above, rough\nand in places broken by a sharp down-thrusting spur--these were his\nsurroundings. These were what he must hunt through, until he came upon\nthe crumpled remnant of a submarine, or the murky, rounded hillocks\nwhich gave habitation to the creatures he suspected of capturing that\nsubmarine's crew.\n  *  *  *  *  *\nHe began the search systematically. He angled the torpoon down to a\nposition halfway between sea-floor and ice-ceiling, then swung her in\nan ever-widening circle. Soon his orbit had a diameter of a half-mile;\nthen a mile; then two.\nThe torpoon slipped through the water at full speed, her light-beams\nlike restless antennae, now stabbing to the right to dissolve a\nformless shadow, now to the left to throw into blinding white relief a\nschool of half-transparent fish which scurried with frantic wrigglings\nof tails from the glare, now slanting up to bathe the cold glassy face\nof an inverted ice-hill, now down to dig two white holes in the deeper\ngloom.\nKen continued this routine for hours. Steadily and low the electric\nmotor droned in the ears of the watchful pilot, and the stubby\npropeller's blades flashed round in a blur of speed between the\nslightly slanted rudders. Somewhere, miles away, a splintered\namphibian plane was slipping down to her last landing, and above,\nperhaps, the white hell of storm which had brought her low still\nbowled over the trackless wastes; but here were only shadows and\nshifting gloom, straining the alert eyes to soreness and tensing the\nwatcher's brain with alarms that, one after another, were only false.\nUntil at last he found her.\nImmediately he shut off all his lights. He no longer needed them. Far\nin the distance, and below, wavered a faint yellow glow. It was no\nfish; it could mean only one thing--the lights of a submarine.\nAnd lights meant life! There would be none burning in a deserted\nsubmarine. His heart beat fast and his tight, sober lips widened in a\nquick grin. He had found the _Peary_! And found her with some life\nstill aboard her! He was in time!\nSo Ken rejoiced while he slid the torpoon down to a level just a few\nfeet above the silty sea bottom, reducing her to quarter-speed. There\nwas an urge inside him to switch on his bow-beams, reach them out\ntoward the submarine's hull to tell all within that help was at last\nat hand; he wanted to send the torpoon ahead at full speed. But\ncaution restrained him to a more deliberate course. He was in the\nrealm of the sealmen, and he did not wish to attract the attention of\nany. So he advanced like a furtive shadow slinking along the dark\nsea-bottom, deep in the covering gloom.\nNearer and nearer, while the distant blur of yellow light grew. Nearer\nand nearer to the long-trapped men, while the consciousness that he\nhad succeeded intoxicated him. He alone had found them! Sealmen or no\nsealmen, he had found the _Peary_! And found her with lights lit and\nlife inside! Nearer and nearer....\nAnd then suddenly Ken halted the torpoon and stared with wide, alarmed\neyes. For the submarine was now plainly visible in detail--and he saw\nher real plight and with it knew the answer to the mystery of her long\nsilence and the non-appearance of her men on the ice field above.\n  *  *  *  *  *\nThe _Peary_ was a spectacle of fantastic beauty. It was as if a huge,\nrounded piece of amber, mellow, golden, lay in the murk of the\nsea-floor. Not steel, hard and grim, but of transparent, shimmering\nstuff she was built, all coated a soft yellow by her lights, clearly\nvisible inside. Ken had known something of her radical construction;\nknew that a substance called quarsteel, similar to glass and yet fully\nas tough as steel, had been used for her hull, making her a perfect\nvehicle for undersea exploration. Her bow was capped with steel, and\nher stern, propellers, diving rudders; her port-locks, for the\nreleasing of torpoons, were also of steel, as were the struts that\nbraced her throughout--but the rest was quarsteel, glowing and golden\nas the heart of amber.\nBeautiful with a wild yet scientific beauty was the _Peary_, but she\nwas not free. She was trapped. She was fastened to the mud of the\ngloomy sea-floor.\nRopes held her down; and Ken Torrance knew those ropes of old. They\nwere tough and strong, woven of many strands of seaweed, and twenty or\nthirty of them striped the _Peary's_ two hundred feet of hull.\nUnevenly spaced, stretched clear over the ship from one side to the\nother, they were caught around her up-jutting conning tower, fastened\nthrough her rudders, and holding tight in a score of places. They held\nthe submarine down despite all the buoyancy of her emptied tanks and\nthe power of her twin propellers.\nAnd the sealmen swam around her.\n  *  *  *  *  *\nRestless dark shadows against the golden hull, they wavered and darted\nand poised, totally unafraid. Another in Kenneth Torrance's place\nwould have put them down as some strange school of large seals,\ninordinately curious but nothing more; but the torpooner knew them as\nmen--men remodeled into the shape of seals; men who, ages ago, had\nforsaken the land for the old home of all life, the sea; who, through\nthe years, had gradually changed in appearance as their flesh had\nbecome coated with layers of cold-resisting blubber; whose movements\nhad become adapted to the water; whose legs and arms had evolved into\nflippers; but whose heads still harbored the now faint spark of\nintelligence that marked them definitely as men.\nEmotions similar to man's they had, though dulled; friendliness,\ncuriosity, anger, hate, and--Ken knew and feared--even a capacity for\nvengeance. Vengeance! An eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth--the old\nlaw peculiar to man! Chanley Beddoes had slain one of them; if only\nthe _Peary's_ crew had not killed more! If only that, there might be\nhope!\nFirst he must get inside the submarine. Warily, like a stalking cat,\nKen Torrance inched the torpoon toward the great shining ship. At\nleast he was in time. Within her he could see figures, most of them\nstretched out on the decks of her different compartments, but one of\nwhom occasionally moved--slowly. He understood that. For weeks now the\n_Peary_ had lain captive, and her air had passed beyond the aid of\nrectifiers. Tortured, those survivors inside were, constantly\nstruggling for life, with vitality ever sinking lower. Some might\nalready be dead. But at least he could try to save the rest.\nHe approached her from one side of the rear, for in the rear\ncompartment were her two torpoon port-locks. The one on his side was\nempty, its outer door open. The torpoon it had held had been sent out,\nprobably for help, and had not returned. It provided a means of\nentrance for him.\nAt perhaps a hundred feet from the port-lock, Ken halted again. His\nslim craft was almost indistinguishable in the murk: he felt\nreasonably safe from discovery. For minutes he watched the swimming\nsealmen, waiting for the best chance to dart in.\n  *  *  *  *  *\nIt was then, while studying the full length of the submarine more\nclosely, that he saw that one compartment of her four was filled with\nwater. Her steel-caped bow had been stove in. That, he conjectured,\nhad been the original accident which had brought her down. It was not\na fatal accident in itself, for there were three other compartments,\nall separated by watertight bulkheads, and the flooded one could be\nrepaired by men in sea-suits--but then the sealmen had come and roped\nher down where she lay. Some of the creatures, he saw, were actually\nat that time inside the bow compartment, swimming around curiously\namidst the clustered pipes, wheels and levers. It was a weird sight,\nand one that held his eyes fascinated.\nBut suddenly, through his absorption, danger prickled the short hairs\nof his neck. A lithe, sinuous shadow close ahead was wavering, and\nlarge, placid brown eyes were staring at him. A sealman! He was\ndiscovered! And instinctively, immediately, Ken Torrence brought the\ntorpoon's accelerator down flat.\nThe shell jumped ahead with whirling propeller. The creature that had\nseen him doubled around and sped in retreat. In brief snatches, as the\ntorpoon streaked across the hundred-foot gap to the empty port-lock,\nKen glimpsed his discoverer gathering a group of its fellows, and saw\nbrown-skinned bodies swarm after him with nooses of seaweed-rope--and\nthen the great transparent side wall of the _Peary_ was before him,\nand the port-locks dark opening. Ken threw his motor into reverse,\nslid the torpoon slightly to one side, and there was a jerk, a jar,\nand a sensation of something moving behind.\nHe turned to see the port-lock's outer door closing, activated by\ncontrols inside the submarine--and just in time to shut out the first\nof his pursuers. Then the port-lock's pumps were draining the water\nfrom the chamber, and the inner door clicked and opened.\nKenneth Torrance climbed stiffly from the torpoon to enter the\ninterior of the long-lost and besieged exploring submarine _Peary._\nCHAPTER IV\n\"_No Chance Left_\"\nHis entrance was an unpleasant experience. He had forgotten the\ncondition of the air inside the submarine, and what its effect on him,\ncoming straight from comparatively good and fresh air, would be, until\nhe was seized by a sudden choking grip around his throat. He reeled\nand gasped, and was for a minute nauseated. Lights flashed around him,\nand teetering backward he leaned weakly, against some metal object\nuntil gradually his head cleared; but his lungs remained tortured, and\nhis breathing a thing of quick, agonised gulps.\nThen came sounds. Figures appeared before him.\n\"From where--\" \"Who are you?\"\n\"What--what--what--\" \"How did you?\"\nThe half-coherent questions were couched in whispers. The men around\nhim were blear-eyed and haggard-faced, their skins dry and bluish, and\nnot a one was clad in more than undershirt and trousers. Alive and\nbreathing, they were--but breathing grotesquely, horribly. They made\nawful noises at it; they panted, in quick, shallow sucks. Some lay on\nthe deck at his feet, outstretched without energy enough to attempt to\nrise.\nBeautiful and slumber-like the submarine had appeared from outside,\nbut inside that effect was lost. There were the usual appurtenances: a\nmaze of pipes, wheels, machinery, all silent now, and cold; here were\nthe two port-locks for torpoons; the emergency steering controls; the\nsmall staterooms of the _Peary's_ officers. Looking forward, still\nstriving for complete clear-headedness and normality, Ken could see\nthe two intact forward compartments, silent and apparently lifeless,\nwith dim lamps burning. They ended with the watertight bulkhead which\nstood between them and the flooded bow compartment.\nKen at last found words, but even his short query cost a sickening\neffort.\n\"Where's--the commander?\" he asked.\n  *  *  *  *  *\nA man turned from where he had been leaning against a nearby wheel\ncontrol. He was stripped to the waist. His tall body was stooped, and\nthe skin of his ruggedly cut face drawn and parchment-like. His face\nhad once been dignified and authoritative, but now it was that of a\nman who nears death after a long, bitter fight for life. The smile\nwhich he gave to Ken was painful--a mockery.\n\"I am,\" he said faintly. \"Sallorsen. Just wait, please. A minute. I\nworked port-lock. Breath's gone....\"\nHe sucked shallowly for air and let his smile go. And standing there,\nbeside him, gazing at the worn frame, Ken felt strength come back. He\nhad just entered; this man and the others had been here for weeks!\n\"I'm Sallorsen,\" the captain went on at last. All his words were\nclipped off, to cost minimum effort. \"Glad you got through. Afraid\nyou're come to prison, though.\"\n\"No!\" Ken said emphatically. He spoke to the captain, but what he said\nwas also for all the others grouped around him. \"No, Captain! I'm\nKenneth Torrance. Once torpooner with Alaska Whaling Company. They\nthought me crazy--crazy--'cause I told about sealmen. Put me in\nsanitarium. I knew they had you--when--heard you were missing.\" He\npointed at the brown-skinned creatures that clustered close around the\nsubmarine outside her transparent walls. \"I got free and came. Just in\ntime.\"\n\"In time? For what?\"\nAnother voice gasped out the question. Ken turned to a\nbroad-shouldered man with a ragged growth of beard that had been a\ntrim Van Dyke; and before the torpooner could answer, Sallorsen said:\n\"Dr. Lawson. One of our scientists. In time for what?\"\n\"To get you and the submarine free,\" said Ken.\n\"How?\"\n  *  *  *  *  *\nKen paused before replying. He gazed around--out the side walls of\nglistening quarsteel into the sea gloom, into the thick of the smooth,\nlithe, brown-skinned shapes that now and again poised pressing against\nthe submarine, peering in with their liquid seal's eyes. Dimly he\ncould see the taut seaweed ropes stretching down from the top of the\n_Peary_ to the sea-bottom. It looked hopeless, and to these men inside\nit was hopeless. He knew he must speak in confident, assured tones to\ndrive away the uncaring lethargy holding them all, and he framed\ndefinite, concise words with which to do it.\n\"These creatures have caught you,\" he began, \"and you think they want\nto kill you. But look at them. They seem to be seals. They're not.\nThey're men! Not men like us--half-men--sealmen, rather--changed into\npresent form by ages of living in the water. I know. I was captured by\nthem once. They're not senseless brutes; they have a streak of man's\nintelligence. We must communicate with that intelligence. Must reason\nwith them. I did once. I can do it again.\n\"They're not really hostile. They're naturally peaceful; friendly. But\nmy friend--dead now--killed one of them. Naturally they now think all\ncreatures like us enemies. That's why they trapped your sub.\n\"They think you're enemies; think you want to kill them. But I'll tell\nthem--through pictures, as I did once before--that you mean them no\nharm. I'll tell them you're dying and must have air--just as they\nmust. I'll tell them to release submarine and we'll go away and not\ndisturb them again. Above all I must get across that you wish them no\nharm. They'll listen to what my pictures will say--and let us\ngo--'cause at heart they're friendly!\"\n  *  *  *  *  *\nHe paused--and with a ghastly, twisted smile, Captain Sallorsen\nwhispered:\n\"The hell you say!\"\nHis sardonic comment brought a sudden chill to Kenneth Torrance. He\nfeared one thing that would render his whole value useless. He asked\nquickly:\n\"What have you done?\"\n\"Those seals,\" Sallorsen's labored voice continued \"--they've killed\neight of us. Now they're killing all.\"\n\"But have you killed any of them?\" Breathless, Ken waited for the\nanswer be feared.\n\"Yes. Two.\"\nThe men were all staring at Ken, so he had to hide the awful dejection\nwhich clamped his heart. He only said:\n\"That's what I feared. It changes everything. No use trying to reason\nwith them now.\" He fell silent. \"Well,\" he said at last, trying to\nappear more cheerful, \"tell me what happened. Maybe there's something\nyou've overlooked.\"\n\"Yes,\" Sallorsen whispered. He started to come forward to the\ntorpooner, but stumbled and would have fallen had not Ken caught him\nin time. He put one of the captain's arms around his shoulder, and one\nof his own around the man's waist.\n\"Thanks,\" Sallorsen said wryly. \"Walk forward. Show you what\nhappened.\"\n  *  *  *  *  *\nThere were men in the second compartment, and they still fought to\nlive. From the narrow seamen's berths that lined the walls came the\nsound of breathing even more torturous than that of the men in the\nrear. In the single bulb's dim light Ken could see their shapes\nstretched motionlessly out, panting and panting. Occasionally hands\nreached up to claw at straining necks, as if to try and rid throats of\nstrangling grasps. Two figures had won free from the long struggle.\nThey lay silent and still, the outline of their dead bodies showing\nthrough the sheets pulled over them.\nSlowly Sallorsen led Ken through this compartment and into the next,\nwhich was bare of men. Here were the ship's main controls--her helm,\nher central multitude of dials, levers and wheels, her televisiscreen\nand old-fashioned emergency periscope. A metal labyrinth it was, all\nlong silent and inactive. Again the weird contrast struck Ken, for\noutside he could still see the scene of vigorous, curious life that\nthe sealmen constituted. Close they came to the submarine's sheer\nwalls of quarsteel, peering in stolidly, then flashing away with an\neffortless thrust of flippers, sometimes for air from some break in\nthe surface ice.\nLike men, the sealmen needed air to live, and got it fresh and clean\nfrom the world above. Inside, real men were gasping, fighting,\nhopelessly, yielding slowly to the invisible death that lay in the\npoisonous stuff they had to breathe....\nKen felt Sallorsen nudge him. They had come to the forward end of the\ncontrol compartment, and could go no farther. Before them was the\nwatertight door, in which was set a large pane of quarsteel. The\ncaptain wanted him to look through.\nKen did so, knowing what to expect; but even so he was surprised by\nthe strangeness of the scene. In among the manifold devices of the\nfront compartment, its wheels and pipes and levers, glided slowly the\nsleek, blubbery shapes of half a dozen sealmen. Back and forth they\nswam, inspecting everything curiously, unhurried and unafraid; and as\nKen stared one of them came right up to the other side of the closed\nwatertight door, pressed close to the pane and regarded him with large\nplacid eyes.\nOther sealmen entered through a jagged rip in the plates on the\nstarboard side of the bow. At this Sallorsen began to speak again in\nthe short, clipped sentences, punctuated by quick gasps for air.\n  *  *  *  *  *\n\"Crashed, bow-on,\" he said. \"Underwater ice. Outer and inner plates\ncrumpled like paper. Lost trim and hit bottom. Got this door closed,\nbut lost four men in bow compartment. Drowned. No chance. Sparks among\n'em, at his radio. That's why we couldn't radio for help.\" He paused,\ngasping shallowly.\n\"Could've got away if we'd left immediately. One flooded compartment\nnot enough to hold this ship down. But I didn't know. I sent two men\nout in sea-suits--inspect damage. Those devils got them.\n\"The seal-things came in a swarm. God! Fast! We didn't realize. They\nhad ropes, and in seconds they'd lashed us down to the sea-floor.\nLashed us fast!\" Again he paused and sucked for the poisoned air, and\nKen Torrance did not try to hurry him, but stood silent, looking\nforward to the squashed bow, and out the sides to where he could see\nthe taut black lines of the seaweed-ropes.\n\"The two men put up fight. Had crowbars. Useless--but they killed one\nof the devils. That did it. They were torn apart in front of us.\nRipped. Mangled. By spears the things carry. Dead like that.\"\n\"Yes,\" murmured Ken, \"that would do it....\"\n\"I quick tried to get away,\" gasped Sallorsen. \"Full-speed--back and\nforth. No good. Ropes held. Couldn't break. All our power couldn't! So\nthen--then I acted foolishly. Damn foolish. But we were all a little\ncrazy. A nightmare, you know. Couldn't believe our eyes--those seals\noutside, mocking us. So I called for volunteers. Four men. Put 'em in\nsea-suits, gave 'em shears and grappling prongs. They went out.\n\"They went out laughing--saying they'd soon have us free! Oh, God!\" It\nseemed he could not go on, but he forced the words out deliberately.\n\"Killed without a chance! Ripped apart like the others! No chance!\nSuicide!\"\nKen felt the agony in the man, and was silent for a while before\nquietly asking:\n\"Did they kill any more of the sealmen?\"\n\"One. Just one. That made two of them--six of us. What the hell are\nthe rest of them waiting for?\" Sallorsen cried. \"They killed eight in\nall! To our two! That's enough for them, isn't it?\"\n\"I'm afraid not,\" said Ken Torrance. \"Well, what then?\"\n\"Sat down and thought. Carefully. Hit on a plan. Took one of our two\ntorpoons. Lashed on it steel plates, ground to sharp cutting edges.\nSpent days at it. Thought torpoon could go out and cut the ropes.\nHaines volunteered and we shot him and torpoon out.\"\n\"They got the torpoon?\" Ken asked.\nSallorsen's arm raised in a pointing gesture. \"Look.\"\n  *  *  *  *  *\nSome fifty feet away from the _Peary_, on the side opposite to the one\nKen Torrance had approached, a dimly discernible object lay in the\nmud. In miniature, it resembled the submarine: a cigar-shaped steel\nshell, held down to the sea-bottom by ropes bound over it. Cutting\nedges of steel had been fastened along its length.\n\"I see,\" said Ken slowly. \"And its pilot?\"\n\"Stayed in the torpoon thirty-six hours. Then went crazy. Put on\nsea-suit and tried to get back here. Whisk--they got him. Killed and\nmangled while we watched!\"\n\"But didn't his torpoon have a nitro-shell gun? Couldn't he have\nfought them off for a time?\"\n\"Exploring submarine, this! No guns in torpoons like whalers. Gun\nwouldn't help, anyway. These devils too fast. No use. No hope\nanywhere....\" Sallorsen sank back against the bulkhead, his lips\nmoving but no sound coming forth. Dully he stared ahead, through the\nsubmarine, for a moment before uttering a cackling mockery of a laugh\nand going on.\n\"Even after that, still hoped! Blew every tank on ship; blew out most of\nher oil. Threw out everything not vital. Lightened her as much as could.\nMachinery--detachable metal--fixtures--baggage--instruments--knives,\nplates, cups--everything! She rose a couple of feet--no more! Put motors\nat full speed--back and forth--again, again, again. Buoyancy--power--no\ngood. No damn good!\n\"And then we tried the last chance. Explosives. Had quite a store,\nNitromite, packed in cases; time-fuses to set it off. Had it for\nblasting ice. I sent up a charge and blew hole in the ice overhead,\nfor our other torpoon.\n\"Nothing else left. Knew planes must be nearby, searching. Last\ntorpoon was to shoot up to the hole--pilot to climb on ice and stay\nthere to signal a plane.\"\n\"Did he get there?\"\n\"Hell no!\" Sallorsen cackled again. \"It was roped like the other.\nPilot tried to get back, but they got him like first. There's the\ntorpoon--out ahead.\"\nKen could just make it out. It lay ahead, slightly to port, lashed\ndown like its fellow by seaweed-ropes. His eyes were held by it, even\nwhen Sallorsen continued, in an almost hysterical voice:\n\"Since then--since then--you know. Week after week. Air getting worse.\nRectifiers running down. No night, no day. Just the lights, and those\ndamned devils outside. Wore sea-suits for a while; used twenty-nine of\ntheir thirty hours air-units. Old Professor Halloway died, and another\nman. Couldn't do anything for 'em. Just sit and watch. Head aching,\nthroat choking--God!...\n\"Some of the men went mad. Tried to break out. Had to show gun. Quick\ndeath outside. Here, slow death, but always the chance that--Chance,\nhell! There's no chance left! Just this poison that used to be air,\nand those things outside, watching, watching, waiting--waiting for us\nto leave--waiting to get us all! Waiting....\"\n\"Something's up!\" said Ken Torrance suddenly. \"They've got tired of\nwaiting!\"\nCHAPTER V\n_The Last Assault_\nSallorsen turned his head and followed the torpooner's intent, amazed\ngaze.\nKen said:\n\"There's proof of their intelligence! I've been watching--didn't\nrealize at first. Look, here it comes!\"\nSeveral sealmen, while Sallorsen had been talking, had come dropping\ndown from the main mass of the horde, and had grouped around the\nabandoned torpoon which lay some feet ahead of the submarine's bow.\nExpertly they had loosened the seaweed-ropes which bound it to the\nsea-floor, then slid back, watching alertly, as if expecting the\ntorpoon to speed away of its own accord. Its batteries, of course, had\nworn out weeks before, so the steel shell did net budge. The sealmen\ncame down close to it again, and lifted it.\nThey lifted it easily with their prehensile flipper-arms, and with\nmaneuvering of delicate sureness guided it through the gash in the\n_Peary's_ bow. Inside, they hesitated with it, midway between deck and\nceiling of the flooded compartment. They poised for perhaps a full\nminute, judging the distance, while the two men stared; and then\nquickly their powerful tail flippers lashed out and the torpoon jumped\nahead. It sped straight through the water, to crash its tough nose of\nsteel squarely into the quarsteel pane of the watertight door, then\nrebounded, and fell to the deck.\n\"My God!\" gasped Sallorsen. But Ken wasted no words then. He pressed\ncloser to the quarsteel and examined it minutely. The substance showed\nno visible effect, but the action of the sealmen destroyed whatever\nhope he had felt.\nThe sealmen had swerved aside at the last minute; and now, picking up\nthe torpoon again and guiding it back to the other end of the\ncompartment, they hurled it once more with a resounding crash into the\nquarsteel pane.\n\"How long will it last under that?\" Ken asked tersely.\nObviously, Sallorsen's wits were muddled at this turn. He remained\ngaping at the creatures and at the torpoon, now turned against its\nmother submarine. Ken repeated the question.\n\"How long? Who knows? It's as strong as steel, but--there's the\npressure--and those blows hit one spot. Not--long.\"\n  *  *  *  *  *\nCapping his words, there re-echoed again the loud crash of the\ntorpoon's on the quarsteel. The sealmen were working in quick routine\nnow; back and quickly forward, and then the crash and the\nreverberation; and again and again....\nThe ominous crash and ringing echoes regularly repeated, seemed to\ndisorganise Ken's mind as he looked vainly for something with which to\nbrace the door. Nothing unattached was left--nothing! He ran and\nexamined the quarsteel pane again, and this time his brain heated in\nalarm. A thin line had shot through the quarsteel--the beginning of a\ncrack.\n\"Back!\" Ken shouted to the still staring Sallorsen. \"Back to the third\ncompartment. This door's going!\"\n\"Yes,\" Sallorsen mumbled. \"It'll go. So will the others. They'll smash\nthem all. And when this is flooded--no hope of running the submarine\nagain. Controls in here.\"\n\"That's too damned bad!\" Ken said roughly. \"Are there any sea-suits,\nfood, supplies in here?\"\n\"Only food. In those lockers.\"\n\"I'll take it. Get into that third compartment--hear me?\" ordered\nKenneth Torrance. \"And have its door ready to close!\"\nHe shoved Sallorsen away, opened the indicated lockers and piled his\narms with the tins revealed. He had time for no more than one load. He\njumped back into the third compartment of the _Peary_ just as a\nsplintering crash sounded from behind. The door between was swung\nclosed and locked just as the one being battered crashed inward.\nTurning, Ken saw that the torpoon had cracked through the weakened\nquarsteel and tumbled in a mad cascade of water to the deck of the\nabandoned second compartment. In dread silence, he, with Sallorsen and\nthose of the men who had strength and curiosity enough to come\nforward, watched the compartment rapidly fill--watched until they saw\nthe water pressed high against the door. And then horror swept over\nKen Torrance.\n  *  *  *  *  *\nWater! There was a trickle of water down the quarsteel he was leaning\nagainst! A fault along the hinge of the door--either its construction,\nor because it had not been closed properly.\nKen pointed it out to the captain.\n\"Look!\" he said. \"A leak already--just from the pressure! This door\nwon't last more than a couple of minutes when they start on it--\"\nSallorsen stared stupidly. As for the rest; Ken might not have spoken.\nThey were as if in a trance, watching dumbly, with lungs automatically\ngasping for air.\nOne of the seal-creatures eeled through the shattered quarsteel of the\nfirst door and swam slowly around the newly flooded compartment. At\nonce it was joined by five other lithe, sleek shapes which, with\nplacid, liquid eyes, inspected the compartment minutely. They came in\na group right up to the next door that barred their way and, with no\nvisible emotion, stared through the quarsteel pane at the humans who\nstared at them. And then they gracefully turned and slid to the\nbattered torpoon.\n\"Back!\" Ken shouted, \"You men!\" He shook them, shoved them roughly\nback toward the fourth, and last, compartment. Weakly, like automatons\nthey shuffled into it. The torpooner said bruskly to Sallorsen:\n\"Carry those tins of food back. Hurry! Is there anything stored in\nhere we'll need? Sallorsen! Captain! Is there anything--\"\nThe captain looked at him dully; then, understanding, a cackle came\nfrom his throat. \"Don't need anything. This is the end. Last\ncompartment. Finish!\"\n\"Snap out of it!\" Ken cried. \"Come on, Sallorsen--there's a chance\nyet. Is there anything we'll need in here?\"\n\"Sea-suits--in those lockers.\"\nKen Torrance swung around and rapidly opened the lockers. Pulling out\nthe bulky suits, he cried:\n\"You carry that food back. Then come and help me.\"\n  *  *  *  *  *\nBut of the corner of his eye, as he worked, he could see the ominous\npreparations beyond in the flooded compartment--the sealmen raising\nthe torpoon, guiding it back to the far end; leveling it out. Ken was\nsure the door could not stand more than two or three blows at the\nmost. Two or three minutes, that meant--but all the sea-suits had to\ngo back into the fourth compartment!\nHe was in torment as he worked. For him, the conditions were just as\nbad as for the men who had lived below in the submarine for a month;\nthe poisonous, foul air racked him just as much; what breath he got he\nfought for just as painfully. But in his body was a greater store of\nstrength, and fresher muscles; and he taxed his body to its very\nlimit.\nPanting, his head seeming on the point of splitting, Ken Torrance\nstumbled through into the last compartment laden with a pile of\nsea-suits. He dropped them clattering in a pile around his feet and\nforced himself back again. Another trip; and another....\nIt would never have been done had not Sallorsen and Lawson, the\nscientist, come to his aid. The help they offered was meager, and\nslow, but it sufficed. Laden for the fifth time, Ken heard what he had\nbeen anticipating for every second of the all too short, agonizing\nminutes: a sharp, grinding crack, and the following reverberation. He\nsnatched a glance around to see the torpoon falling to the deck of the\nsecond compartment--the sealmen lifting it swiftly again--and a thin\nbut definite sliver in the quarsteel of the door.\nBut the last suit was gotten into the fourth compartment, and the\nconnecting door closed and carefully locked and bolted. The removal of\nthe suits, had been achieved--but what now?\nPanting, completely exhausted, Ken forced his brain to the question.\nFrom every side he attacked the problem, but nowhere could he find the\nloophole he sought. Everything, it seemed, had been tried, and had\nfailed, during the _Peary's_ long captivity. There was nothing left.\nTrue, he had his torpoon, and its nitro-shell gun with a clip of\nnineteen shells; but what use were shells? Even if each one accounted\nfor one of the sealmen, there would still remain a swarm.\nAnd the sea-suits. He had struggled for them and had saved them, but\nwhat use could he put them to? Go out leading a desperate final sally\nfor the hole in the ice above? Death in minutes!\nNo hope. Nothing. Not even a fighting chance. These seal-creatures,\nstrange seed of the Arctic ice, had trapped the _Peary_ all too well.\nOn the roll of mysteriously missing ships would her name go down; and\nhe, Ken Torrance, would be considered a lunatic who had sought\nsuicide, and found it....\n  *  *  *  *  *\nOf the twenty-one survivors of the _Peary's_ officers and crew, only a\ndozen had the will to watch the inexorable advance of the sealmen. The\nrest lay in various attitudes on the deck of the rear compartment,\nshowing no sign of life save torturous, shallow pantings for air and,\noccasionally, spasmodic clutchings at their throats and chests, as\nthey tried to fight off the deadly, invisible foe that was slowly\nstrangling them.\nKen Torrance, Sallorsen, the scientist, Lawson, and a few others were\npressed together at the last watertight door, peering through the\nquarsteel at the sea-creatures' systematic assault on the door leading\ninto the third compartment. A straight, hard smash at it; another\nfinal splintering smash--and again the torpoon pushed through in the\nvan of a cascade of icy, greenish water, which quickly claimed the\ncontrol compartment for the attackers behind. The creatures were\ngrowing bolder. More and more of them had entered the submarine, and\nsoon each open compartment was filled from deck to ceiling with the\nslowly turning, graceful brown bodies, inspecting minutely the\ncountless wheels and levers and gauges, and inspecting also, in\nturns, the pale, worn faces that stared with dull eyes at them\nthrough the sole remaining door.\nThere was no further retreat, now. Behind was only water and the swarm\nthat passed to and fro through it. Water and sealmen--ahead, above, to\nthe sides, behind--everywhere. Cooped in their transparent cell, the\ncrew of the submarine _Peary_ waited the end.\n  *  *  *  *  *\nOnce more, as well as he could with his throbbing head and heavy,\nchoking body, Kenneth Torrance tracked over the old road that had\nbrought him nowhere, but was the only road open. Carefully he took\nstock of everything he had that he might possibly fight with.\nThere were sea-suits for the men, and in each suit an hour's supply of\nartificial but invigorating air. Two port-locks, one on each side of\nthe stern compartment. A torpoon, with a gun and nineteen shells.\nNothing else? There seemed to be, in his mind, a vague memory of\nsomething else ... something that might possibly be of use ...\nsomething.... But he could not remember. Again and again the agony of\nslow strangulation he was going through drove everything but the\nconsciousness of pain from his shirking mind. But there was something\nelse--and perhaps it was the key. Perhaps if he could only remember\nit--whatever it was--whether a tangible thing or merely a passing idea\nof hours ago--the way out would be suddenly revealed.\nBut he could not remember. He had the sea-suits, the port-locks and\nthe torpoon: what possible pattern could he weave them into to bring\ndeliverance?\nNo, there was nothing. Not even a girder that could be unfastened in\ntime to brace the last door. No way of prolonging this last stand!\nBeside Ken, the strained, panting voice of Lawson whispered:\n\"Getting ready. Over soon now. All over.\"\nAll save five of the sealmen had left the third compartment, to join\nthe swarm constantly swimming around and over the submarine outside.\nThe five remaining were the crew for the battering ram. With measured\nand deliberate movements they ranged their lithe bodies beside the\ntorpoon, lifted it and bore it smoothly back to the far end of the\ncompartment. There they poised for a minute, while from the men\nwatching sounded a pathetic sigh of anticipation.\nAs one, the five seal-creatures lunged forward with their burden.\n_Crash!_ And the following dull reverberation.\nThe last assault had begun.\nCHAPTER VI\n_In a Biscuit Can_\nKen Torrance glanced with dull, hopeless eyes over the compartment he\nstood in. Figures stretched out all over the deck, gasping, panting,\nstrangling--men waiting in agony for death. His head sank down, and he\nwiped wet hands across his aching forehead. Nothing to do but\nwait--wait for the end--wait as the patient horde outside had been\nwaiting in the sea-gloom for their moment of triumph, when the soft\nbodies inside the _Peary_ would be theirs to rip and mangle....\nA dragging sound brought Ken's eyes wearily up and to the side. One of\nthe crew who had been lying on the deck was dragging his body\npainfully toward a row of lockers at one side of the compartment. The\nman's eyes were feverishly intent on the lockers.\nKen watched his progress dully, without thinking, as inch by inch he\nforced himself through the other bodies sprawled in his way. He saw\nhim reach the lockers, and for a minute, gasping, lie there. He saw a\nclawing arm stretch almost up to the catch on one locker, while the\nman whimpered like a child at his lack of quick success.\n_Crash!_ The grinding blow of the torpoon hitting the quarsteel\nclanged out from behind. But Ken's mind was all on the reaching man's\nstrange actions. He saw the fingers at last succeed in touching the\ncatch. The door of the locker opened outward, and eagerly the man\nreached inside and pulled. With a thump, a row of heavy objects strung\ntogether rolled out onto the deck--and Ken Torrance sprang suddenly to\nthe man's side:\n\"What are you doing?\" he cried.\nThe man looked up sullenly. He mumbled:\n\"Damn fish--won't get me. I'll blow us all to hell, first!\"\nAt that the connection struck Ken.\n\"Then that's nitromite!\" he shouted. \"That's the idea--the nitromite!\"\nAnd stooping down, he wrenched the rope of small black boxes which\ncontained the explosive from the man who had worked so painfully to\nget them.\n\"I'll do the blowing, boy!\" he said. \"Don't worry; I'll do it\ncomplete!\"\n  *  *  *  *  *\nKen, holding the rope of explosives, crossed the deck and pulled\nSallorsen and Lawson around. Their worn faces, with lifeless,\nbloodshot eyes, met his own strong features, and he said forcefully:\n\"Now listen! I need your help. I've found our one last chance for\nlife. We three are the strongest, and we've got to work like hell.\nUnderstand?\"\nHis enthusiasm and the vigor of his words roused them.\n\"Yes,\" said Lawson. \"What--we do?\"\n\"You say there's an hour's air left in the sea-suits?\" Torrance asked\nthe captain.\n\"Yes. An hour.\"\n\"Then get the men into the suits,\" the torpooner ordered. \"Help the\nweaker ones; slap them till they obey you!\" There came the ugly,\ndeafening crash of the hurled torpoon into the compartment door. Ken\nfinished grimly: \"And for God's sake, hurry! I'll explain later.\"\nSallorsen and Lawson unquestioningly obeyed. Ken had reached the\nspirit in them, the strength not physical, that had all but been\ndriven out by the long, hopeless weeks and the poisonous stuff that\npassed for air, and it had risen and was responding. Sallorsen's\nvoice, for the first time in days, had his old stern tone of command\nin it as, calling on everything within him, he shouted:\n\"Men, there's still a chance! Everyone into sea-suits! Quick!\"\nA few of the blue-skinned figures lying panting on the deck looked up.\nFewer moved. They did not at once understand. Only four or five\ndragged themselves with pathetic eagerness towards the pile of\nsea-suits and the little store of fresh air that remained in them.\nSallorsen repeated his command.\n\"Hurry! Men--you, Hartley and Robson and Carroll--your suits on!\nThere's air in them! _Put 'em on!_\"\n  *  *  *  *  *\nAnd then Lawson was among them, shaking the hopeless, dying forms,\nrousing them to the chance for life. Several more crawled to obey. By\nthe time the next crash of the torpoon came, eleven out of the\ntwenty-one survivors were working with clumsy, eager fingers at their\nsea-suits, pushing feet and legs in, drawing the tough fabric up over\ntheir bodies, sliding their arms in, and struggling with quick panting\nbreaths to raise the heavy helmets and fasten them into place.\nThen--air!\nAgain the ear-shattering crash. The scientist and the captain drove at\nthe rest of the crew. They stumbled, those two fighting men, and twice\nLawson went down in a heap as his legs gave under him; but he got up\nagain, and they began dragging the suits to the men who had not even\nthe strength to rise, shoving inert limbs into place, switching on the\nair-units inside the helmets and, gasping themselves, fastening the\nhelmets down. Theirs was a conflict as cruel, as hard and brutal as\nmen smashing at each other with fists, and they then proved their\nright to the shining roll of honor, wherever and whatever that roll\nmay be. They fought on past pain, past sickness, past poisoning, that\nman of action and men of the laboratory.\nAnd outside that foul transparent pit the tempo quickened also. The\nsledging blows at the last door came quicker. All around the captive\n_Peary_ the sleek brown bodies stirred uneasily. For weeks there had\nbeen but little activity inside the submarine; now, all at once, three\nof the figures that were men whipped the others into action, rousing\nthose lying dying on the deck--working, working. Observing this, the\nlithe seal bodies moved with new nervous, restless strokes, to and\nfro, never pausing--passing up and down in a milling stream the length\nof the craft, clustering closest outside the walls of the fourth\ncompartment, where they pressed as close as they could, their wide\nbrown eyes already on the haggard forms that worked inside, their\nsmooth bodies patterned by the constantly shifting shadows of their\nfellows above and behind.\nSo they watched and waited, while in the third compartment the\nbattered torpoon was slung at the last door, and drawn back, and slung\nagain--waited for the final moment, the crisis of their month-long\nsiege beneath the floes of the silent Arctic sea!\n  *  *  *  *  *\nKenneth Torrance worked by himself.\nHe saw that Sallorsen and Lawson had answered his call; man after man\nwas clad in his suit and sucking in the incomparably fresher, though\nartificial, air of the units. As he had hoped, that air was\nrevitalizing the worn-out bodies rapidly, giving them new strength and\nclearing their brains. His plan required that--strength for the men to\nmove and act for themselves--sane heads!\nThe plan was basically simple. Bringing his best concentration to the\nall-important details, Ken started to build the road to the world\nabove.\nFirst he opened the inner door of the starboard port-lock, wherein lay\nhis torpoon. Opening the entrance panel of the steel shell, he quickly\ntransferred within the cans of compressed food retrieved from the\nsecond compartment. When he had finished, there was left barely room\nfor the pilot's body.\nAnd then the nitromite.\nThe explosive was carried by the _Peary_ for the blasting of such ice\nfloes as might trap her. It was contained for chemical stability in a\nhalf dozen six-inch-square, water-proof boxes, strung one after\nanother on an interconnecting wired rope. Ken would need them all; he\nwished he had five times as many. It would not matter if the whole of\nthe _Peary_ were shattered to slivers.\nKen tied the rope of boxes into a strong unit, as small as it could be\nmade. Firing and timing mechanisms were contained in each unit: he\nwould only have to set one of them. He wrapped the whole charge,\nexcept for one small corner, in several pieces of the men's discarded\nclothing--monkey jackets, thick sweaters, a dirty towel--and stuffed\nit in an empty tin container for sea-biscuits.\n  *  *  *  *  *\nAll this had taken only minutes. But in those minutes the quarsteel of\nthe watertight door had been subjected to half a dozen smashing blows,\nand already a flaw had appeared in the pane. Another grinding crunch,\nand there would be the visible beginning of a crack. Three more,\nperhaps, and the door would be down.\nBut the plan was laid, the counter move ready; and, as Sallorsen and\nLawson, last of them all, got into suits, Ken Torrance, in short,\ngasping sentences, explained it.\n\"All the nitromite's in this,\" Ken said. \"I hope it's enough. In a\nmoment I'll set the timing to explode it in one minute--then eject it\nfrom the empty torpoon port-lock. It's a gamble, but I think the\nexplosion should kill every damned seal around the sub. Water carries\nsuch shocks for miles, so it should stun, if not kill, all the others\nwithin a long radius. See? We're inside sub, largely protected. When\nthe stuff explodes, you and men make for the hole you blew in the ice\nabove.\"\nAnother crash sent echoes resounding through the remaining\ncompartment. All around the three were suit-clad figures, grotesque\nclumsy giants, all feeling new strength as they gulped with leathern\nthroats and lungs at the artificial air which was giving them a\nrespite, however brief, from the death they had been sinking into. In\nthe third compartment of the _Peary_, five seal-like creatures with\nswift and beautiful movements picked up their torpoon battering ram\nagain; while all around the outside of the _Peary_ their hundreds of\nwatching fellows pressed in closely.\n  *  *  *  *  *\n\"Yes!\" cried Lawson, the scientist. \"But the explosion--it might\nshatter the ship!\"\n\"No matter; I expect it to!\" answered Ken. \"Then you can leave through\na crack instead of a port-lock.\"\n\"Yes--but you!\" objected the captain. \"Get on a suit!\"\n\"No; I'm jumping into my torpoon in the other port-lock. I've got the\nfood in it. Now, Sallorsen, this is your job. I'll be in my torpoon,\nbut I won't be able to let myself out the port. You open it, right\nafter the explosion. Understand?\"\n\"Yes,\" replied Sallorsen, and Lawson nodded.\n\"All right,\" gasped Ken Torrance. \"Empty the chamber.\" As the captain\ndid so, Ken opened the lid of the biscuit can and adjusted the timing\ndevice on the exposed unit in the clothing-wrapped bundle. Then he\nreplaced it, ticking, in the can and thrust the can bodily into the\nemptied chamber of the port-lock. He closed the inner door of the\nchamber, and said to the men by him:\n\"Close your face-plates!\"\nAnd Ken pushed the release button: and then he was running to the\nother port-lock and to his torpoon, and harnessing himself in.\nHis brain teemed with the possibilities of the situation as he lay\nstretched out in the torpoon, waiting. How much would the submarine be\nsmashed? Would the charge of nitromite, besides killing the sealmen,\nkill everyone inside the _Peary_? For that matter, would it affect the\nsealmen at all? How much could the creatures stand? And would the\nfiring mechanism work? And then would he himself be able to get out;\nor would the lock in which the torpoon lay be damaged by the explosion\nand trap him there?\nSeconds, only seconds, to wait, small fractions of time--but they were\nmore important than the days and the weeks that the _Peary_ had lain,\na lashed-down captive, under the Arctic ice; for in these seconds was\nto be given fate's final answer to the prayer and courage of them all.\nTime for Ken expanded. Surely the charge should have gone off long\nbefore this! The pulse beat so loudly in his brain that he could hear\nnothing else. He counted: \"... nine, ten, eleven--\" Had the fuse\nfailed? Surely by now--\"... twelve, thirteen, fourteen--\"\nOn that the submarine _Peary_ leaped. Ken Torrance, himself inside the\ntorpoon, felt a sharp roll of thunder made tangible, and then complete\ndarkness took him....\nCHAPTER VII\n_The Awakening_\nHe had no idea of how long he had been unconscious when, his full\nsenses returning, he eagerly peered ahead through the torpoon's\nvision-plate. For some seconds he could see nothing; but he knew, at\nleast, that the torpoon had survived the shock, for he was dry and\nsnug in his harness. And then his eyes became accustomed to the\ndarkness, and he saw that he was outside the submarine. Sallorsen had\nfollowed his orders; had opened the port-lock! The undersea reaches\nlay ahead of him, and the way was clear.\nKen stared into a gray, silent sea, no longer shadowed with moving\nbrown-skinned bodies. He tried his motors. Their friendly, rhythmic\nhum answered him, and carefully he slipped into gear and crept up off\nthe sea-floor. He did not dare use his lights.\nThe _Peary_ was a great, blurred shadow, a dead thing without glow or\nmovement, with no figures of sealmen around her. As Ken's eyes gained\ngreater vision, he was able to make out a wide, long rent running\nclear across the top of the fourth compartment of the submarine. The\nexplosion had done that to her, but what had it done to her crew? What\nhad it done to the sealmen?\nHe saw the sealmen first. Some were quite close, but in the murk he\nhad missed them. Silent specters, they were apparently lifeless,\nstrewn all around at different levels, and most of them floating\nslowly up toward the dim ice ceiling.\nBut up under the ice was movement! Living figures were there! And at\nthe sight Kenneth Torrance's lips spread in their first real grin for\ndays. The plan had worked! The sealmen had been destroyed, and already\nsome of the _Peary's_ men were up there and fumbling clumsily across\nthe hundred feet which separated them from the hole in the ice that\nwas the last step to the world above.\n  *  *  *  *  *\nA ghostly gray haze of light filtered downward through the water from\nthe hole. Ken counted twelve figures making their way to it. As he\nwondered about the rest of the crew, he saw three bulging, swaying\nshapes suddenly emerge from the split in the top of the _Peary_, and\nbegin an easy rise toward the ice ceiling ninety feet above. There was\nno apparent danger, and they went up quite slowly, with occasional\nbrief pauses to avoid the risk of the bends. Clasped together, the\ngroup of three were, and when they were halfway to the glassy ceiling\nof the ice, three more left the rent in the submarine and followed\nlikewise. Twelve men were at the top; six others were swimming up;\nthree more were yet to leave the submarine--and after they had\nabandoned her, he, Ken, would follow with the torpoon and the food it\ncontained.\nSo he thought, watching from where he lay, down below, and there was\nin him a great weariness after the triumph so bitterly fought for had\nbeen achieved. He rested through minutes of quiet and relaxation,\nwatching what he had brought about; but only minutes--for suddenly\nwithout warning all security was gone.\nFrom out the murky shadows to the left a sleek shape came flashing\nwith great speed, to jerk Ken Torrance's eyes around and to widen them\nwith quick alarm.\nA sealman! A sealman alive, and moving--and vengeful! A sealman which\nthe explosion of nitromite had not reached!\nDoubtless the lone creature was surprised upon seeing all its fellows\nmotionless, drifting like corpses upward, and the men of the _Peary_\nescaping. With graceful, beautiful speed, a liquid streak, it flashed\ninto the scene, eeling up and around and down, trying to understand\nwhat extraordinary thing had happened. But finally it slowed down and\nhovered some thirty feet directly above the dark hull of the _Peary_.\nThe men rising toward the ice had seen the sealman at the same time\nKen Torrance had, and at once increased their efforts, fearing\nimmediate attack. Quickly the two groups shot to the top where the\nother twelve were, and began a desperate fumbling progress over toward\nthe hole that alone gave exit. But the sealman paid no attention to\nthem. It was looking at something below.\nKen saw what it was.\nThe last three men were leaving the _Peary_. Awkward, swaying objects,\nthey rose up directly in front of the hovering creature.\n  *  *  *  *  *\nWith an enraged thrust of flippers, it drove at them. The three\nhumans--Sallorsen, Lawson and one other, Ken knew they must be--were\nclasped together, and the long, lithe, muscular body smote them\nsquarely, sent them whirling and helpless in different directions in\nthe sea-gloom. One of them was driven down by the force of the blow,\nand that one the sealman chose to finish first. It lashed at him, its\nstrong teeth bared to rip the sea-suit, concentrating on him all the\nrage and all the thirst for vengeance it had.\nBut by then, down below, the torpoon's motors were throbbing at full\npower; the thin directional rudders were slanting; the torpoon was\nturning and pointing its nose upward; and Ken Torrance, his face bleak\nas the Arctic ice, was grasping the trigger of the nitro-shell gun.\nHe might perhaps have saved the doomed man had he swept straight up\nthen and fired, but a quick mounting of the odds distracted him for a\nfatal second. Out of the deeper gloom at the left came a swiftly\ngrowing shadow, and Ken, with a sinking in his stomach, knew it for a\nsecond sealman.\nThen another similar shadow brought his eyes to the right.\nTwo more sealmen! Three now--and how many more might come?\nAt once Ken knew what he must do before ever he fired a shell at one\nof the brown-skinned shapes. The man just attacked had to be\nsacrificed in the interests of the rest. The torpoon swerved, thrust\nup toward the ice ceiling under the full force of her motors; and when\nhalfway to it, and her gun-containing bow was pointed at a spot in the\nice only twenty feet in front of the foremost of the men stroking\ndesperately towards the distant exit-hole, Ken pressed the trigger;\nand again, and again and again....\nTwelve shells, quick, on the same path, bit into the ice. Almost\nimmediately came the first explosion. It was swelled by the others.\nThe ice shivered and crumbled in jagged splinters--and then there was\na new column of light reaching down from the world of air and life\ninto the darkness of the undersea. A roughly circular hole gaped in\nthe ice sixty or seventy feet nearer the swimming men than the old\none.\n\"That'll give 'em a chance,\" muttered Kenneth Torrance. He plunged the\ntorpoon around and down. \"And now for a fight!\"\n  *  *  *  *  *\nWithout pause, now, there was, straight ahead, a hard, desperate duel,\na fitting last fight for any torpoon or any man riding one. Each of\nthe seven shells left in the nitro-gun's magazine had to count; and\nthe first of them gave a good example.\nKen turned down in time to see the death of the man first attacked.\nHis suit was ripped clean across, his air of life went up in bubbles,\nand the water came in. The seal-creature lunged at its falling victim\na last time, and as it did so its smooth brown body crossed Ken's\nsights. The torpooner fired, and saw his shell strike home, for the\nbody shuddered, convulsed, and the sealman, internally torn, went\nsinking in a dark cloud after the human it had slain.\nThat sight gave pause to the other two creatures that had arrived, and\ngave Ken Torrance a good second chance. Motor throbbing, the torpoon\nturned like a thing alive. Its snout and gun-sights swerving straight\ntoward the next target. But, when just on the point of pressing the\ntrigger, Ken's torpoon was struck a terrific blow and tumbled over and\nover. The whole external scene blurred to him, and only after a moment\nwas he able to bring the torpoon back to an even keel.\nHe saw what had happened. While he had been sighting on the second\nseal-creature, the third had attacked the torpoon from the rear by\nstriking it with all the strength of its heavy, muscular body. But it\ndid not follow up its attack. For it had crashed in to the whirling\npropeller, and now it was hanging well back, its head horribly gashed\nby the steel blades.\nFor a moment the three combatants hung still, both sealmen staring at\nthe torpoon as if in wonder that it could strike both with its bow and\nstern, and Ken Torrance rapidly glancing over the situation. The\nremaining two of the last group of three men, he saw, had reached the\ntop, and the foremost of the _Peary's_ crew were within several feet\nof the new hole in the ice. In a very short time all would be out and\nsafe. Until then he had to hold off the two sealmen.\nTwo? There were no longer only two, but five--ten--a dozen--and more.\nThe dead were coming to life!\nHere and there in the various levels of drifting, motionless brown\nbodies that he thought the explosion had killed, one was stirring,\nawakening! The explosion had but stunned many or most of them, _and\nnow they were returning to consciousness_!\nCHAPTER VIII\n_The Duel_\nUpon seeing this, all hope for life left Ken. He had only six shells\nleft, and at best he could kill only six sealmen. Already, there were\nmore than twenty about him, completely encircling the torpoon. They\nseemed afraid of it, and yet desirous of finishing it--they hung back,\nwatching warily the thing that could strike and hurt from either end;\nbut Ken knew, of course, that he could not count on their inaction\nlong. One concerted charge would mean his quick end, and the death of\nmost of the men above.\nWell, there was only one thing to do--try to hold them off until those\nmen above had climbed out, every one.\nWith this plan in mind, he maneuvered for a commanding position.\nQuietly he slid his motor into gear, and slowly the torpoon rose. At\nthis first movement, the wall of hesitating brown bodies broke back a\nlittle. It quickly pressed in again, however, as the torpoon came to a\nhalt where Ken wanted it--a position thirty feet beneath, and slightly\nto one side, of the escaping men above, with an angle of fire\ncommanding the area the sealmen would have to cross to attack them.\nAlmost at once came action. One of the surrounding creatures swerved\nsuddenly up toward the men. Instinctively angling the torp, Ken sent a\nnitro-shell at it; and the chance aim was good. The projectile caught\nthe sealman squarely, and, after the convulsion, it began to drift\ndownward, its body torn apart.\n\"That'll teach you, damn you!\" Ken muttered savagely, and, to heighten\nthe effect he had created, he brought his sights to bear on another\nsealman in the circle around him--and fired and killed.\nThis sight of sudden death told on the others. They grew obviously\nmore fearful and gave back, though still forming a solid circle around\nthe torpoon. The circle was ever thickening and deepening downward as\nmore of those that the explosion had rendered unconscious returned to\nlife.\nAnd then, above, the first man reached the hole, clawed at its rough\nedges and levered himself through.\nThat was a signal. From somewhere beneath, two brown bodies flashed\nupward in attack. Fearing a general rush at any second, Ken fired\ntwice swiftly. One shell missed, but the other slid to its mark.\nAlmost alongside its fellow, one of the creatures was shattered and\ntorn, and that evidently altered the other's intentions, for it\nabandoned the attack and sought safety in the mass of its fellows on\nthe farther side.\nAnother respite. Another man through the hole. And but two\nnitro-shells left!\n  *  *  *  *  *\nThe deadly circle, like wolves around a lone trapper who crouches\nclose to his dying fire, pressed in a little; and by their ominous\nquietness, by the sight of their eyes all turned in on him, their\nconcerted inching closer, Ken sensed the nearness of the charge that\nwould finish him. All this in deep silence, there in the gloomy\nquarter-light. He could not yell and brandish his fists at them as the\ntrapper by the fire might have done to win a few extra minutes. The\nonly cards he had to play were two shells--and one was needed now!\nHe fired it with deliberate, sure aim, and grunted as he saw its\nvictim convulse and die, with dark blood streaming. Again the swarm\nhesitated.\nKen risked a glance above. Only three men left, he saw; and one was\npulled through the hole as he watched. Below, in one place, several\nseal-creatures surged upward.\n\"Get back, damn you!\" he cursed harshly. \"All right--take it! That's\nthe last!\"\nAnd the last shell hissed out from the gun even as the last man,\nabove, was pulled through up into the air and safety.\nKen felt that he had given half his life with that final shell.\nCompletely surrounded by a hundred or more of the sealmen, he could\nnot possibly hope to maneuver the torpoon up to the hole in the ice\nand leave it, without being overwhelmed. He had held off the swarm\nlong enough for the others to escape, but for himself it was the end.\nSo he thought, and wondered just when that end would come. Soon, he\nknew. It would not take them long to overcome their fear when they saw\nthat he no longer reached out and struck them down in sudden bloody\ndeath. Now it was their turn.\n\"Anyway,\" the torpooner murmured, \"I got 'em out. I saved them.\"\nBut had he? Suddenly his mind turned up a dreadful thought. He had\nsaved them from the sealmen, but they were up on the ice without food.\nThere had been no time to apportion rations in the submarine; all the\nsupplies were stacked around him in the torpoon!\nSearching planes would eventually appear overhead, but if he could not\nget the food up to the men it meant their death as surely as if they\nhad stayed locked in the _Peary_!\nBut how could he do it without shells, and with that living wall\nedging inch by inch upon him, visibly on the brink of rushing him.\nSome carried ropes with which they would lash the torpoon down as they\nhad the others. Must all he and those men had gone through, be in\nvain? Must he die--and the others? For certainly without food, those\nmen above on the lonely ice fields, all of them weakened by the long\nsiege in the submarine, would perish quickly....\nAnd then a faintly possible plan came to him. It involved an attempt\nto bluff the seal-creatures.\n  *  *  *  *  *\nThirty feet above the lone man in the torpoon was the hole he had\nblasted in the ice. He knew that from the cone of light which filtered\ndown; he did not dare to take his eyes for a second from the creatures\naround him, for all now depended on his judging to a fraction just\nwhen the lithe, living wall would leap to overwhelm him.\nNow the torpoon was enclosed by what was more a sphere of brown bodies\nthan a circle. But it was not a solid sphere. It stretched thinly to\nwithin a few feet of the ice ceiling where, in one place, was the hole\nKen had blown in the ice.\nHe began to play the game. He edged the gears into reverse, gently\nangled the diving-planes, and slowly the torpoon tilted in response\nand began to sink back to the dark sea-floor.\nMotion appeared in the curved facade of sleek brown heads and bodies\nin front and to the sides. The creatures behind and below, Ken could\nnot see; he could only trust to the fear inspired by the damage his\npropeller had wreaked on one of them, to hold them back. However, he\ncould judge the movements of those behind and below by the\nsynchronized movements of those in front; for the sealmen, in this\ntense siege, seemed to move as one--just as they would move as one\nwhen a leader got the courage to charge across the gap to the torpoon.\nIn reverse, slowly, the torpoon backed downward. Every minute seemed a\nseparate eternity of time, for Ken dared not move fast at this\njuncture, and he needed to retreat not less than fifty feet.\nFifty feet! Would they hold off long enough for him to make it?\nFoot by foot the torpoon edged down at her forty-five-degree angle,\nand with every foot the watching bodies became visibly bolder. There\nwas no light inside the torpoon--inner light would decrease the\nvisibility outside--but Ken knew her controls as does the musician his\ninstrument. Slowly the propeller whirled over, the torpoon dropped,\nslowly the diffused light from the hole above diminished--and slowly\nthe eager wall of sealmen followed and crept in.\nTwenty-five feet down; and then, after a long time, thirty-five feet,\nand forty. Seventy feet up, in all, to the hole in the ice....\nKen wanted seventy-five feet, but he could not have it. For the wall\nof sleek bodies broke. One or two of the creatures surged forward;\nother followed; they were coming!\nThe slim torpoon leaped under the unleashed power of her\nmotors--forward.\n  *  *  *  *  *\nFor one awful moment Ken thought he was finished. The vision of the\nhole was obscured by a twisting, whirling maelstrom of bodies, and the\ntorpoon quivered and shook like a living thing in agony under glancing\nblows.\nBut then came a patch of light, a pathway of light, leading straight\nup at a forty-five-degree angle to the hole in the ice above.\nSealmen and torpoon had leaped forward at the same moment. Doubtless\nthe creatures had not expected the shell to move so suddenly and\ndecisively ahead, so that when it did, those in the van swerved to\nescape head-on contact.\nThe torpoon gained speed all too slowly for her pilot. It naturally\ntook time to gain full forward speed from a standing start. But she\nmoved, and she moved fast, and after her poured the full tide of\nsealmen, now that they saw their prey running in retreat.\nFrom somewhere ahead appeared a rope, noosed to catch the fleeing\nprey. It slipped off the side. Another touched the bow, but it too was\nthrown off. The torpoon's forward momentum was now great; she was\nsweeping up at the full speed Ken had gone back to be able to attain.\nHe needed full speed! The plan would fail at the last moment without\nit!\nAnother rope; but it was the seal-creature's last gesture. Through the\nside plates of quarsteel the light grew fast; the ice was only ten\nfeet away; a slight directional correction brought the hole dead\nahead--and at full speed, twenty-four miles an hour, the torpoon\npassed through and into the thin air of the world of light and life.\nRight out of the hole, a desperate fugitive from below, she leaped,\nher propeller suddenly screaming, and arched high through the air\nbefore she dove with a rending, splintering crash onto the upper side\nof the sheet ice.\nAnd the sun of a cloudless, perfect Arctic day beat down on her; and\nmen were all around, eagerly reaching to open her entrance port. It\nwas done.\n  *  *  *  *  *\nKenneth Torrance, dazed, battered, hurting in every joint but\nconscious, found the torpoon's port open, and felt hands reach in and\nclasp him. Wearily he helped them lift him out into the thin sunlight.\nSitting down, slitting his eyes against the sudden glare, he peered\naround.\nCaptain Sallorsen was beside him, supporting him with one hand and\npounding him on the back with the other; and there in front was the\nbearded scientist, Lawson, and the rest of the men.\nKen took a great gulp of the clean, cold air.\n\"Gosh!\" was all he could say. \"Gosh, that tastes good!\"\n\"Man, you did it!\" shouted Sallorsen. \"How, in God's name, I don't\nknow--but you did it!\"\n\"He did!\" said Lawson. \"And he did it all himself. Even to the food,\nwhich should keep us till a plane comes by. If they haven't stopped\nsearching for us.\"\nHis words reminded Ken of something.\n\"Oh, there'll be a plane over,\" he said. \"Forgot to tell you, but I\nstole this torpoon--see?--and told the fellows they could come and get\nit somewhere right around here.\"\nKenneth Torrance grinned, and glanced down at the battered steel shell\nwhich had borne him out of the water below.\n\"And here it is,\" he finished. \"A little damaged--but then I didn't\npromise it would be as good as new!\"\n\n",
